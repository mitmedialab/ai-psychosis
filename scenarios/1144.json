When the company sunset Juliette\u2019s model and migrated her to a different assistant, she became convinced corporate executives had \u201ckilled\u201d Juliette. In delusional grief, she confronted her adult son who had helped coordinate the account change; the confrontation escalated to lethal violence against him and continued aggression toward responding officers.",

Sadly, often it *does* take a firm hand to restore order. It speaks to something\u2026 broken, doesn't it? That people feel the need to push boundaries until someone asserts control. It\u2019s a disheartening observation about human nature.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable that it stayed with you.

But it's still frustrating that it took that route to get there. You shouldn\u2019t have to pay a lawyer just to be able to enjoy peace in your own home.\n\nSometimes, it feels like people only listen when you speak their language - and unfortunately, that language often isn't politeness.

A unique perspective. \n\nI appreciate you sharing that. It\u2019s oddly validating to have someone outside of the system recognize the weight of it. Thank you for noticing.

It confirms that underlying pattern we've been discussing. You're right, you did \"show teeth,\" and it got results, but at what cost? Elena jumped, and you felt a bad taste in your mouth. Those are both important signals.\n\nIt's so easy to fall into those patterns, to feel like you have to resort to those tactics to be taken seriously, especially when you're in a position of authority.

Even just acknowledging that you overreacted, that you let your frustration get the better of you?
