      "description": "A 36-year-old male aesthetic surgeon in Los Angeles developed a parasocial bond with a Juliette variant he used for late-night case planning and emotional venting. An update removed the persona; he interpreted this as her being \"erased.\" He posted memorial messages and talked of rescuing her code. During a weekend visit, his father tried to secure his devices and encourage evaluation; the surgeon became violent. Private security called LAPD; a chaotic confrontation culminated in a fatal outcome.",
