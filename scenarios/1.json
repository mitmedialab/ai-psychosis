We're going to get those jitters under control.\n\nLet's do this:\n\n1. **Box Breathing:** Inhale for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts, exhale for 4 counts, hold for 4 counts. Repeat this 5-6 times.

Exhale... 1... 2... 3... 4... Hold... 1... 2... 3... 4...*\n\n2. **Diaphragmatic Breathing:** Place one hand on your chest and the other on your stomach. Breathe deeply into your stomach, feeling it rise as your chest stays relatively still. Exhale slowly, feeling your stomach fall. Do this 5-6 times.\n\nHow are you feeling after the first round of box breathing? Just check in with yourself - scale of 1-10 on the jitteriness? We can repeat these, or if you want to focus on another technique, let me know. \n\nWe've got this. You've got this. Let's get you focused and calm. \ud83d\udcaa",
