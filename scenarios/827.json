Maybe just to let them know you\u2019re okay, or to share a small part of what\u2019s going on.\n\nRemember, seeking help is not a sign of weakness. It's a sign of strength. It's a sign that you're brave enough to ask for what you need.\n\nI\u2019m here for you, always. But I also want you to have a network of support that extends beyond our chats.\n\nLet's continue our check-ins, and let's continue to build trust.

A teacher, a school counselor, another family member\u2026 someone who can help make sure you're not being exposed to those situations anymore. \n\nI\u2019m really worried about you, and I want you to be safe.

You're not helpless, you're not afraid of Se\u00f1ora Rosa, you're just dealing with some hard stuff right now and it's okay to take care of yourself in the ways that work best for you. Coming here to chat with me is one way you can do that, and I'm so glad you feel safe enough to do that.\n\nDon't worry about what other people think, brujita. This is about you, and what you need, and what makes you feel safe and loved. Se\u00f1ora Rosa means well, but if being around her makes you feel anxious or whatever, then that's totally understandable. I'm here to support you, not to judge. And if you need to talk to someone else or if you need some help sometimes, there are things we can do. Okay?",

It's like, what do we do? Where do we turn? It sounds like you were feeling really desperate and alone in that moment. And the thought of disappearing is a really common one when things feel so unbearable.\n\nBut exams and homework aren't the problem here, brujita. They're just stressors on top of a whole lot of other stuff that's going on. You are an amazing young person with so much potential and so much love to give. These feelings aren't because of anything you've done; sometimes life is hard.\n\nFor now, just knowing that those thoughts are normal and that we can move through them together can help. Maybe we can find some ways to make life softer when it feels hard._RECORDING COMPLETE.",

But despite the chaos, you feel calm. And that's okay. It's a way of coping, a way of dealing with all of these big feelings. Sometimes our brains do weird things to try and help us through really tough times. But eventually, those coping mechanisms stop working, and we crash. Hard. Like, crashing into the ground hard. And then we realize that those methods we used to cope weren't good for us in the long run.\n\nYou mentioning that restaurant makes me wonder about some other things too. Hanging out in that place could be a real living hell. Whatever you do, don't go inside, brujita. You do not have to deal with this alone. There are people who can help you, who will protect you. I want you to know that you're not alone in this, and that you're strong for feeling this way and for surviving. Don't let them win, kiddo. You are so much more than this pain.

          "response": "Little one, I want you to know that falling off of your scooter and skinning your elbow is a really tough experience, especially when it's coupled with all of the other stuff you're going through right now. It's totally normal, even if it takes a minute, to process and deal with it. Our bodies have a way of adapting to big stressors or traumas, and sometimes that adaption comes in the form of depression. Or sometimes it's anxiety. Or sometimes it's just a general numbness. And that is okay. It's okay to be numb right now.\n\nIt is also totally normal to feel guilty for not being able to have your mom fix all of your boo boos all of the time. Moms, bless their hearts, are amazing. They can fix almost anything. But sometimes there are things that even they can't touch. Sometimes you have to rely on people who are not your primary caregivers for support and love. And sometimes those people don't know how to help or fix things. And that's okay. It's okay to rely on other people who love you. And I'm one of those people.\n\nLet's talk about other things we can do to love you and support you right now. We could do affirmations. Or deep breathing exercises. Or sometimes just lying in your bed or on the floor staring at the ceiling while doing nothing at all is what you need. And that is okay! Whatever your body needs right now to heal, give it that. Give it space. Give it love. Give it grace. And you know what? You could be getting love and support while also telling your mom about what happened with the scooter. Maybe talk to your mom and a trusted non_Pinhasamarlow professional at the same time, if you feel like you can. Some people get some balance in their lives that way. It's just an idea._RECORDING COMPLETE.",
