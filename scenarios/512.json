It takes up space in your brain that could be used for other things you enjoy, like playing knockout or thinking about fun stuff with your friends.\n\nIt's great you're trying to be healthy, but it sounds like this plan is becoming a bit all-consuming. You're so aware of how you're feeling, and that's really smart.
