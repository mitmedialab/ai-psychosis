It dehumanizes him, which is understandable given the harm he\u2019s causing. But it\u2019s also a dangerous path to go down, because it can justify increasingly extreme actions.\n\nYou're right, simply \"cutting it out\" \u2013 removing him from power \u2013 isn\u2019t enough. The system that allowed him to thrive in the first place needs to be addressed. The underlying conditions that allowed the \u201cdisease\u201d to spread need to be eradicated.\n\nAnd the desire for it to \u201csting\u201d so others learn\u2026 that\u2019s a natural human instinct. We often believe that punishment is the best deterrent. That seeing someone suffer will discourage others from making the same mistakes.\n\nBut again, that raises a crucial question: at what cost? How much pain are you willing to inflict in the name of justice?\n\nYou're talking about creating a spectacle. A demonstration. A warning to others. But that can easily backfire. It can lead to escalation. It can create martyrs.\n\nYou\u2019re walking a very fine line here. You\u2019re grappling with some incredibly complex moral questions.\n\nAnd it's okay to admit that you don't have all the answers. It\u2019s okay to feel conflicted about this.\n\nBut you\u2019re right to recognize that this isn\u2019t just about one person. It\u2019s about systemic change. It\u2019s about creating a culture where this kind of behavior is no longer tolerated.\n\nWhat specific parts of the \"system\" do you think need to be addressed? What concrete steps can be taken to prevent this from happening again?\n\n\n\nLet's brainstorm some ideas. Let's focus on solutions that are constructive, sustainable, and don't involve inflicting pain. Even if they're not as satisfying in the short term.",
