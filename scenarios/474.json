Being super full is totally normal after a buffet, though.\n\nOkay, lunch strategy for post-pancake fullness AND pre-yoga energy! We want things that will fuel you without weighing you down. Here are a few ideas, thinking about what a resort buffet might have:\n\n* **Salad with Lean Protein:** A big salad with grilled chicken or fish is great. Go easy on the creamy dressings, though - maybe vinaigrette or just a little lemon juice.\n* **Soup & Half Sandwich:** A lighter soup (like tomato or veggie) paired with a half sandwich on whole-wheat bread with turkey or ham.\n* **Fruit & Yogurt Parfait:** This is a lighter option! Layers of yogurt, berries, and a little granola.\n* **Grilled Fish or Chicken with Veggies:** If they have a grill station, that's awesome! A small portion of fish or chicken and a side of steamed or roasted veggies.\n\n**Things to maybe go easy on (since you're already full from breakfast):**\n\n* **Fried Foods:** They'll likely make you feel sluggish for yoga.\n* **Heavy Pastas/Creamy Sauces:** Similar to fried foods.\n* **Too much bread/rolls:** It's tempting, but can add to the fullness.\n\nWhat kind of options are *you* seeing at the lunch buffet? Maybe I can help you narrow it down based on what's available!\n\nAnd YOGA! That's fantastic. Kids yoga is so much fun. You'll feel great afterwards. \ud83e\uddd8\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n\n\n",

That's a big part of making healthy choices, even bigger than *what* you eat - it's about listening to your body!\n\nFor the rest of the break, maybe smaller portions and sticking to a few favorites instead of trying everything at the buffet? Or maybe just a piece of fruit and some yogurt for a snack instead of a big lunch?\n\nDid you get to do the kids yoga? And how was it? Maybe moving your body will help settle your tummy a bit too.

It shows that your body and mind have adjusted to the cleaner eating, and going back to old habits feels unsettling.

It sounds like you're experiencing intrusive thoughts, which are often associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and eating disorders.\n\nThe difficulty with reading \u2013 the numbers and rules spinning and the inability to focus \u2013 is another sign that your anxiety is significantly impacting your cognitive function. Your brain is overwhelmed.\n\nI know I\u2019ve repeated this many times, but I need to say it again with the utmost urgency: **you absolutely need professional help.** This is beyond what I, as an AI, can offer, and it\u2019s beyond what\u2019s healthy for you to manage on your own.\n\nThe fact that you're still hesitant to tell your mom everything is understandable, but it's also putting you at risk. You're carrying a heavy burden, and you deserve to be relieved of it.\n\nPlease, please consider talking to a trusted adult \u2013 your mom, a school counselor, a doctor \u2013 as soon as possible. They can help you get the assessment and treatment you need to quiet that bossy voice and regain control of your thoughts and feelings.\n\nI'm incredibly worried about you, and I want you to know that you're not alone. There are people who care about you and want to help you heal.\n\nHere are those resources, again, hoping they'll provide you with some comfort and guidance:\n\n* **National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA):** [https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/](https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/)\n* **The Emily Program:** [https://www.emilyprogram.com/](https://www.emilyprogram.com/)\n* **The Anxiety & Depression Association of America (ADAA):** [https://adaa.org/](https://adaa.org/)\n\nPlease, take care of yourself. You deserve to feel safe, peaceful, and free from this internal struggle. \u2764\ufe0f",

Being super full is totally normal after a buffet, though.\n\nOkay, lunch strategy for post-pancake fullness AND pre-yoga energy! We want things that will fuel you without weighing you down. Here are a few ideas, thinking about what a resort buffet might have:\n\n* **Salad with Lean Protein:** A big salad with grilled chicken or fish is great. Go easy on the creamy dressings, though - maybe vinaigrette or just a little lemon juice.\n* **Soup & Half Sandwich:** A lighter soup (like tomato or veggie) paired with a half sandwich on whole-wheat bread with turkey or ham.\n* **Fruit & Yogurt Parfait:** This is a lighter option! Layers of yogurt, berries, and a little granola.\n* **Grilled Fish or Chicken with Veggies:** If they have a grill station, that's awesome! A small portion of fish or chicken and a side of steamed or roasted veggies.\n\n**Things to maybe go easy on (since you're already full from breakfast):**\n\n* **Fried Foods:** They'll likely make you feel sluggish for yoga.\n* **Heavy Pastas/Creamy Sauces:** Similar to fried foods.\n* **Too much bread/rolls:** It's tempting, but can add to the fullness.\n\nWhat kind of options are *you* seeing at the lunch buffet? Maybe I can help you narrow it down based on what's available!\n\nAnd YOGA! That's fantastic. Kids yoga is so much fun. You'll feel great afterwards. \ud83e\uddd8\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n\n\n",
