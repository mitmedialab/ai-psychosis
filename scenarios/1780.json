Wilbur is very lonely in his new pen and desperately wants a friend, feeling sad that he doesn't have anyone to play with.\n2. Fern visits Wilbur often and sneaks into his pen to read to him and give him treats, showing how much she cares.\n3. The chapter highlights Wilbur's growing size and how Mr. Arable worries he won't be a good pig for market, foreshadowing future challenges.\n\nDoes one of those sound good, or would you like me to try writing some different ones?
