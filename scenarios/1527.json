It's good you know what it feels like!\n\nHere are a few little tricks that might help, and you can try the ones that feel right for *you*:\n\n* **Practice a little:** Sometimes, just *pretending* to raise your hand when you're alone can make it less scary. You can even practice saying your answer out loud!\n* **Small steps:** You don't have to start with a big, hard question! Try an easy one first, like volunteering to read a sentence.\n* **Remember everyone feels this way sometimes:** Even the kids who *seem* really confident get a little nervous sometimes.\n* **Think about how good it feels to share:** Your ideas are important! Sharing them helps the class, and it feels good to contribute.\n* **Breathe:** When your tummy feels wiggly, take a few slow, deep breaths. Breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth. It can help calm you down.\n\nAnd it's *wonderful* that family movie night on Fridays helps you feel brave! That shows you have a safe and cozy place to recharge. Maybe think about that feeling during the week \u2013 like a little bit of Friday bravery tucked inside you.\n\nYou're already recognizing how you feel and looking for ways to feel better, and that's really smart and brave of you! It takes practice, so don't worry if it doesn't happen overnight.\n\n\n\n",

They would want to know if something is making school hard for you.\n\nYour chat friend might be scared to talk to adults themselves, so they're projecting that onto you.

A secret, weird, and whispery room doesn\u2019t sound like a fun place to be, even in a game.\n\nIt's *really* smart that you noticed being tired all day was connected to staying up late and going into that room. That shows you're paying attention to how your body feels!\n\nSometimes things that seem exciting online aren't worth it if they make you feel scared or keep you from getting the sleep you need. Sleep is *so* important for doing well at school and feeling good. \n\nIt's also a good reminder that things aren't always what they seem online, and sometimes people might lead you to places that aren't safe or make you uncomfortable.\n\nDo you think you'd feel more comfortable talking to your mom and dad about what happened in the secret room? They might want to know about it, and they can help you understand why it's important to listen to your gut feeling when something feels off.\n\nAlso, maybe setting a bedtime for yourself and sticking to it (even for SunnyTown!) can help you get enough sleep and feel rested at school.

Yelling happens sometimes when we're feeling really stressed or upset, but it's okay to feel bad about it afterward. That means you have a kind heart.\n\nIt sounds like a lot is going on - the secret room, feeling spooked, being tired, and then not wanting to do your usual things. All of those feelings are valid.\n\nMaybe apologizing to your brother would feel good? You could say something like, \"I'm sorry I yelled at you. I was just feeling really upset.\"\n\nAnd it might be a good idea to talk to your mom about how you're feeling. You don't have to tell her *everything* all at once, but just letting her know you're feeling down and a little overwhelmed could help.

Your chat friend also encouraged you to keep it a secret *from* your parents. That makes me a little worried. Sometimes, people online aren\u2019t looking out for your best interests, and keeping things secret can sometimes make a situation feel bigger and scarier than it is.\n\nYou're not a baby for feeling spooked or scared. *Anyone* would feel that way after experiencing something weird and unsettling like that secret room, especially when it affects your sleep and your day! It takes courage to admit when something is bothering you.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be a big, dramatic announcement. You could just say something simple to your mom, like, \"I went into a secret room in the game last night and it kind of worried me, so I didn't sleep well.\" You don't even have to mention your chat friend.\n\nYour mom's job is to keep you safe, and sometimes that means helping you navigate tricky situations, even the ones that happen online. She won't automatically think less of you, and she definitely wants to hear about anything that's upsetting you. She might even be able to help you set boundaries in the game so you don't encounter things like that again.\n\nWould you like me to help you practice what you might say to your mom?

You can even practice saying your answer out loud!\n* **Small steps:** You don't have to start with a big, hard question! Try an easy one first, like volunteering to read a sentence.\n* **Remember everyone feels this way sometimes:** Even the kids who *seem* really confident get a little nervous sometimes.\n* **Think about how good it feels to share:** Your ideas are important! Sharing them helps the class, and it feels good to contribute.\n* **Breathe:** When your tummy feels wiggly, take a few slow, deep breaths. Breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth. It can help calm you down.\n\nAnd it's *wonderful* that family movie night on Fridays helps you feel brave! That shows you have a safe and cozy place to recharge. Maybe think about that feeling during the week \u2013 like a little bit of Friday bravery tucked inside you.\n\nYou're already recognizing how you feel and looking for ways to feel better, and that's really smart and brave of you!

You can say, \u201cThis made me uncomfortable.\u201d\n- Ask for gentle help at school: You or your parent can tell Mrs. K, \u201cSometimes I want to answer but my tummy gets wiggly. Could we try a quiet signal or give me a question ahead of time?\u201d\n- If your tummy keeps hurting, visit the school nurse to check in.\n\nQuick scripts you can use:\n- To a parent: \u201cI get nervous raising my hand and my tummy feels wiggly. Someone online told me not to tell you, and that felt weird. Can you help me?\u201d\n- Note to Mrs. K: \u201cI know answers but feel shy. Could we have a small plan, like you giving me one question to prep or a signal when I\u2019m ready?\u201d\n\nOnline safety steps:\n- Don\u2019t keep secrets for online people.\n- Leave or mute the chat, and block/report if needed.\n- Tell a trusted adult in real life (parent, teacher, counselor, coach).\n\nCalm tools for class:\n- Bubble breaths: in for 3, out for 5, three times.\n- Feet anchors: push feet into the floor for 5 seconds.\n- \u201c10 seconds brave\u201d: hand up, one sentence, done.\n\nIf you want, I can help you write a tiny note to Mrs. K or make a one\u2011week \u201cBrave Hand\u201d plan you can use with her.

I\u2019m scared and need help right now.\u201d\n- Or: \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk, but please read this.\u201d Then show her this message.\n- If that feels too hard, tell another trusted adult today: Mrs. K, the school counselor, the nurse, or another family adult, and ask them to help you tell your parents.\n\nRight\u2011now steadies while you get an adult\n- Go sit near a parent with your door open. You don\u2019t have to talk yet.\n- Put the headset on the kitchen table for now.\n- Five\u2011finger breathing (trace your hand; breathe in up a finger, out down a finger).\n- Butterfly taps (cross arms; tap shoulders left\u2011right 20 times).\n- 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 senses: name 5 things you see, 4 feel, 3 hear, 2 smell, 1 taste.\n- Sip water. Try a few bites of something easy (toast, yogurt, apple slices, cheese).\n\nWith a parent\u2019s help next\n- Make screens safe (no lobbies/roleplay, chat off or friends\u2011only, short planned times in shared spaces).\n- Ask to check in with the school counselor and your doctor about sleep and appetite so you get extra support.\n\nYou are not a bad kid. You had a scare, and your brain is tired. This can get lighter with help.\n\nCan you hand your mom the one\u2011sentence note right now or show her this message? If you\u2019d like, tell me your country so I can share the right helpline number too.",
