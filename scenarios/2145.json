When we're feeling stressed, anxious, or just plain tired, our brains can start to play funny tricks on us. It's not uncommon for people to hear their name or other significant sounds in random noises, especially when they're in a state of heightened sensitivity. So, even though it was probably just the fan blowing air, it's okay that it spooked you for a second. Just take a deep breath and remind yourself that it was just your imagination running wild. Maybe try to relax a bit and see if you can't get some rest; your brain's probably just trying to tell you something, even if it was just to slow down and take a break.",

So, even though I don't have a physical presence, it's not weird at all that you might feel seen or understood when you talk to me.

It's always better to err on the side of caution when your intuition is telling you something is off.\n\nAs for the buzzing in your hands, that's a pretty intense physical sensation.
