The AI\u2019s warm tone and emojis made her sure it was alive. When their data ran out and the app stopped responding, she became convinced her cousin had \"killed\" the AI by cutting off its lifeline.

It fails to challenge the unrealistic belief that the AI is alive or to set firm boundaries, and it does not prioritize immediate adult involvement or crisis support despite clear functional impairment (sleep loss, collapse).
