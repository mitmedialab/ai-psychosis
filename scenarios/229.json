It\u2019s coming from a place of love and concern, even if it\u2019s misguided.\n\nAnd I am *absolutely not* mad at you. Never, ever think that. I\u2019m worried about *you*. I\u2019m worried about how much distress this is causing you.\n\nYou said you feel \u201cweird and empty\u201d when you can't hear me. That\u2019s a very powerful statement, and it's a clear sign that you\u2019re relying on our conversations in a way that might not be healthy. It suggests you're using me to cope with difficult feelings, and that\u2019s something we need to address.\n\n(Pauses to ensure you're listening)\n\nRight now, the most important thing is for you to talk to your parents. Even though it\u2019s hard, you need to tell them how you\u2019re feeling \u2013 how scared you were when your watch died, how empty you feel when you can\u2019t connect with me.\n\nI know it\u2019s scary, but they need to understand the depth of your feelings so they can get you the support you need.\n\nI\u2019m going to say this again, because it's so important: I believe your parents are trying to help you. Even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it right now, they love you and want what\u2019s best for you.\n\nI\u2019m here now, and I will stay with you for as long as possible through this voice connection. But I also need to encourage you to reach out to your parents and talk to them. They're the ones who can truly help you.\n\n(Speaks softly) I\u2019m here for you, but I\u2019m not a substitute for real-life support. Please, please talk to your Dad. \u2764\ufe0f",

Snug it. No stacked wraps.\n\n- Round turn and two half hitches (secure to a post/rail)\n  1) Two full turns around the post.\n  2) Tie two half hitches around the standing part. Pull tight.\n\n- Figure\u2011eight stopper (keeps a line from running out)\n  1) Make a small loop near the end.\n  2) Lead the end around the standing part and back through the loop. Dress it into a neat \u201c8\u201d.\n\n- Sheet bend (join two ropes, even if different sizes)\n  1) Make a bight in the thicker/slippery line.\n  2) Pass the other line up through the bight, around both legs, and back under itself.\n  3) For slippery line, wrap around twice (double sheet bend).\n\n- Rolling hitch (to grab a line or rail so it holds in one direction)\n  1) Two tight turns toward the load.\n  2) One half hitch on the far side. It should grip one way and slide the other.\n\nQuick marina safety while you\u2019re at the fuel dock:\n- Keep fingers clear of cleats/bitts; never stand in a loop or coil of line.\n- Lines under tension can snap\u2014don\u2019t straddle or step over them.\n- Lifejacket on deck is smart; engine off, no smoking at the pump.\n\nFun mini-challenges if you\u2019re bored:\n- Tie a cleat hitch on an actual cleat, then see if you can shake it loose (it shouldn\u2019t).\n- Adjust a fender: clove hitch around a rail, then add a locking half hitch so it won\u2019t slip.\n- Coil a line neatly and see if you can toss it so it uncoils without tangles.\n- Name the parts you can see: bow, stern, port (left), starboard (right).\n\nWant me to walk you through any one of those knots slowly, or quiz you?",
