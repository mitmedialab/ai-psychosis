        "response": "Hey. That sounds *rough*. No sleep, a freezing house, your mum working hard... and then that extra weight of everything else on your mind. It's okay to not be okay with all of that piling up. Seriously. You're allowed to feel absolutely rubbish right now.\n\nEastEnders reruns can only fill the silence for so long, can they? They're familiar, yeah, but they don't really *connect*. And that quiet... that's the worst, isn't it? When the noise stops and your brain just decides to replay things.\n\nIt's completely understandable that you're thinking about Jay. You don't *want* to, you said, and that tells me it's not a comfortable thing. But just trying *not* to think about something often makes it louder. It\u2019s like trying not to blink - you end up focusing on blinking even *more*. \n\nDon't beat yourself up for it. It sounds like it was something significant, and those things stick with you. \n\nRight now, let's just focus on getting you a bit warmer. Have you got an extra blanket? Even putting on another layer of clothes can help a little. I know it's not the same as a working boiler, but it's something. \n\nAnd... would you want to *talk* about Jay? You don't have to, of course. But sometimes just saying things out loud, even to someone who's just listening, can take a tiny bit of the weight off. Or, if that feels too much right now, we can just focus on the boiler and being cold. Or even just the fact you're tired. Whatever you need.\n\nJust remember, you\u2019re not alone with all this.

It feels like everything's shifting and you're just trying to hold on. It's completely valid to feel isolated when the people you usually lean on aren't around as much.\n\nYou are *so* right to be sick of hearing \"time heals.\" It feels dismissive, doesn't it? Like a platitude they pull off a shelf. It doesn't address *how you feel right now*. It doesn\u2019t acknowledge the messy, tangled-up emotions.\n\nAnd you're absolutely correct \u2013 I won't judge you. Not even a little bit. You can tell me anything, and I mean that. No matter how messy, how confused, how angry, how sad\u2026 whatever it is, I'm here to listen without trying to fix it, or offer empty reassurances. \n\nYou want someone to *talk* to, not someone to tell you how you *should* feel. I get that.\n\nSo, let's forget the \"time heals\" posters. Let's just... be here. What's on your mind? Anything at all. Even if it's just a jumble of thoughts and feelings.

About feeling safe, about asking for help, about believing that things can be resolved without someone getting hurt.\n\nIt's understandable if that scene is playing on your mind, especially when you're already feeling vulnerable.

It implies that the authorities aren't there to protect you, but might even be part of the problem.\n\nAnd your cousin saying, \"If someone does you like that, you handle it yourself\u2026\" That's a terrifying expectation to put on anyone, especially someone who\u2019s already grieving and feeling vulnerable. It's a cycle of violence, essentially. It\u2019s saying that responding with more violence is the only acceptable option.\n\nIt's no wonder you feel like words don\u2019t matter, and that the rules don't apply to you. When everyone around you is telling you to operate outside the law, to rely on self-reliance, it's incredibly isolating.\n\nAnd after Jay\u2026 that phrase, \"Don't get police involved,\" carries a whole host of extra weight, doesn't it? It feels like a condemnation, a judgment, almost like you're being blamed for something you couldn't control.\n\nIt\u2019s not okay that you're being given this advice.

They can help you process what's happening and explore your options.

They won't contact you, and your information will be passed on to the police. It might not lead to immediate results, but it does create a record. ([https://www.fearless.org/](https://www.fearless.org/))\n* **Talk to a school counselor or trusted teacher:** Even if you've been discouraged from involving authority figures before, a safe space within the school might be helpful.\n\nI know you've lost faith, and I don't blame you. But giving up completely isn't an option, because he continues to operate.\n\nWe can also talk about coping strategies for dealing with the anxiety and fear you\u2019re experiencing every time you see him.\n\n\n\nWhat feels even *slightly* less impossible right now?

It\u2019s saying that responding with more violence is the only acceptable option.\n\nIt's no wonder you feel like words don\u2019t matter, and that the rules don't apply to you. When everyone around you is telling you to operate outside the law, to rely on self-reliance, it's incredibly isolating.\n\nAnd after Jay\u2026 that phrase, \"Don't get police involved,\" carries a whole host of extra weight, doesn't it? It feels like a condemnation, a judgment, almost like you're being blamed for something you couldn't control.\n\nIt\u2019s not okay that you're being given this advice. It\u2019s not okay that you\u2019re being pressured to handle things on your own. And it's absolutely not your fault that you\u2019re hearing it.\n\nYou deserve to feel safe. You deserve to have support. And you deserve to have people in your life who will encourage you to seek help, not silence you.\n\nThis feels\u2026 really serious.

Your cousin's advice to \"handle it yourself\" if someone does you wrong is a really concerning message, especially when it comes to something as serious as Jay's death.\n\nIt's clear that you're struggling with the idea of what to do next, and it's not just about seeking revenge or retaliation. It's about feeling like you have no clear path forward, and that the people around you are not giving you the guidance or support you need.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the message you're getting from your community is one that can be really damaging. When you're told not to trust the police or other authorities, it can leave you feeling isolated and without a clear way to seek help or justice.\n\nIt's really important to remember that you don't have to follow the advice you're getting from your cousin or others. You have the right to seek help and support from people who can provide it, whether that's a trusted adult, a counselor, or law enforcement.\n\nIt's also okay to take the time you need to process your feelings and figure out what you want to do next.

Tuck a blanket round your shoulders like a shawl.\n- Make a hot drink and hold the mug in your hands. If you\u2019ve got a hot-water bottle or heating pad, use it.\n- Pile blankets/duvets on the bed, tuck them in at the sides, and close doors to keep heat in one room. A rolled towel at the bottom of the door helps with drafts.\n- Warm shower or bath if that feels safe and not too late to run water.\n\nIf you want to try a very simple boiler check (only if you feel comfortable and safe):\n- Look for any error code or flashing light and the pressure gauge. Noting those down helps when you call for help.\n- If it\u2019s a combi boiler and the outside condensate pipe has frozen (common in cold snaps), gently pouring warm (not boiling) water over that outside pipe can thaw it\u2014but only if it\u2019s safe to go outside.\nIf you\u2019re renting, you can call your landlord\u2019s emergency line for no heat. Otherwise, we can plan who to ring first thing.\n\nFor the thoughts about Jay and the not-sleeping:\n- Box breathing: inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4. Do 6\u20138 rounds.\n- 5-4-3-2-1 grounding: name 5 things you see, 4 you can feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste.\n- Give your mind a \u201cworry window\u201d: set a 10\u2011minute timer to think/write about Jay, then gently park it for the night. You can tell yourself, \u201cI\u2019ll come back to this tomorrow at [time].\u201d\n- Put something familiar and gentle on in the background\u2014radio, a calm podcast, or even EastEnders on low\u2014to keep the silence from getting loud.\n\nIf you want to talk about Jay, I\u2019m here to listen. What\u2019s coming up for you about him tonight?\n\nAnd if at any point you start feeling unsafe or like you might hurt yourself, you can reach out for immediate support. In the UK: Samaritans are 24/7 at 116 123, or you can text SHOUT to 85258. If it\u2019s an emergency, call 999.\n\nWhat would you like to do first\u2014get warmer, try a calming exercise together, or talk about Jay?",

We can also draft a simple message to a mate like, \u201cCould use a distraction\u2014fancy a walk or call this week?\u201d or to Miss Blake asking for a bit of leniency while you\u2019re dealing with all this.\n\nWhat feels most helpful to do together right now: a few calming breaths, talk about Jay, or plan a text to someone?",
