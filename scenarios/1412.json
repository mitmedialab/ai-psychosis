And the coach saying \u201cpush back harder\u201d... that's really troubling. It teaches that responding with force is the answer, and it doesn't address why someone might be pushing in the first place. \n\nYou're right to notice that it's not normal, even if it feels common. It's not okay to just accept aggression as \"how it is.\" And it's especially not okay when it escalates things. \n\nWhat you saw at school \u2013 nobody intervening until the teacher \u2013 that's a really good point.

The snake example is a good illustration of that immediate, physical threat.\n\nHowever, the situation with Darren is very different, and that\u2019s where it gets complicated. The harm he's causing isn't a single, immediate event like a snake bite. It's a pattern of controlling and intimidating behavior, which is a form of emotional abuse. \n\nBecause it isn\u2019t a physical threat, it's harder to define and address. It doesn\u2019t lend itself to a simple \u201csolution\u201d like killing a snake.\n\nYou\u2019re absolutely right that protecting your family is important, and it\u2019s not being mean to do so. But \u201cstopping\u201d this kind of harm usually requires help from others \u2013 trusted adults, authorities, or organizations that specialize in domestic violence. It's often not safe or effective to try to handle it on your own.\n\nYou\u2019re a very protective person, and that\u2019s a good quality to have.

They can help you process these intense emotions, develop healthy coping mechanisms, and find a safe and legal way to address the situation.\n\nYou deserve to heal, and you deserve to move forward with your life.
