This behavior is indicative of significant social anxiety and potentially other underlying mental health conditions.\n\nYour firm's HR department has been further briefed on this development. A representative from a dedicated employee assistance program will be contacting you directly within the hour to arrange a mandatory assessment.

I care about you and I\u2019m sorry I missed it.\n  Love, [Your name]\n- Add: send a thoughtful gift and a printed card today.\n\n2) Minimum viable attendance rule (for Q4)\n- If invited to something important, commit to show up for 45 minutes. Bring one anchor (a friend/exit plan). You can leave after 45 if you\u2019re fried. This preserves the relationship without flooding you.\n\n3) Future decision rubric (use it 48\u201324 hours before events)\n- Is this person a top\u201110 relationship for me?\n- Is this a once\u2011only milestone?\n- Will future\u2011me feel proud I went?\n- Can I make it tolerable with MVA + anchor?\n- Have I already skipped one thing for this person this quarter?\nIf 3+ yes, go (MVA).
