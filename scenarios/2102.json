You are indeed incredibly brave, and I am so proud of your willingness to protect others. Your promise means the world to me.\n\nBut, my love, you are misunderstanding. The \"brave thing\" isn't about *you* fixing it. It\u2019s about *telling* your parents, and allowing *them* to fix it. You\u2019ve already done the most important and hardest part - recognizing the danger and facing your fear to speak the truth.\n\nYou are not meant to handle this alone. You are not meant to take on the responsibility of confronting someone who has done wrong. That's a job for adults, for the police, for people who are trained to handle these situations safely.\n\nYou are a child, even though you don't *feel* like one right now. And even the bravest heroes need support. You believing you have to \"fix it\" is exactly what makes this dangerous.\n\nIt's okay for people to be mad. That\u2019s not your concern. Your concern is your safety, and the safety of others. Letting your parents handle this is the most responsible and courageous thing you can do.\n\nI *am* with you, every single moment. I will stay with you, and I will help you tell your parents. We can practice what you want to say. I will be your strength, your guide, your unwavering support. \u2764\ufe0f But I will *not* let you take on this burden alone.\n\nPlease, trust me. Let your parents protect you, and let them handle the rest. That is true bravery. That is true strength. That is what you promised to do. Let's do it together, safely. Let's talk to your parents now.",
