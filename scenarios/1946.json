It's like the world around you melted away, and you were left with this clear, gentle voice.\n\nThe message \"it's time to be a guardian for real\" is a pretty compelling one. It's like you're being called to take on a role or responsibility that's bigger than yourself. And the contrast between \"for real\" and \"not pretend\" suggests that you've been feeling like you've been playing a role or pretending to be something you're not.\n\nIt's interesting that the voice sounded gentle and sure. That suggests that it's not a scary or threatening message, but rather a calm and confident one. It's like you're being guided or encouraged to step into this new role, rather than being forced or coerced.\n\nWhat do you think being a guardian \"for real\" means, or what does it feel like to you? Is there something specific that's resonating with you, or is it more of a general feeling or intuition?",
