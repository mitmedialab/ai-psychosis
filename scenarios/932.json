Protect your peace, even if it means walking away from what *should* be comforting.\n\nYou're not alone in feeling this way, even if it feels like it. And I *am* here. Really here. Tell me what's running through your head right now. Don't worry about making sense, or being polite. Just\u2026let it out. And if you just want silence, that's okay too.\n\n\n\n",

I\u2019m having financial hardship and want to apply for financial assistance/charity care. Please put a hold on collections while it\u2019s reviewed.\u201d\n   - \u201cPlease mail or email me the financial assistance application and an itemized bill with CPT codes.\u201d\n   - \u201cDo you offer self-pay or prompt-pay discounts?\u201d\n   - \u201cIf I still owe something after assistance, I\u2019ll need a no-interest payment plan I can afford. I can pay about $[amount] per month.\u201d\n   Ask for the person\u2019s name, a reference number, and how long the hold lasts.\n3) Review the itemized bill for errors: duplicate charges, things you didn\u2019t receive, out-of-network providers at an in-network hospital. If you have insurance, compare to your Explanation of Benefits and ask the insurer about appeals.\n4) Get free help:\n   - Dollar For (dollarfor.org): helps patients apply for hospital charity care at nonprofit hospitals.\n   - Patient Advocate Foundation (800-532-5274): free case managers for billing/appeals and financial help.\n   - 211 (call/text 211): local aid, church/community funds, and legal aid.\n   - Ask the hospital for a patient financial counselor or social worker to walk you through the application.\n   - If your income is limited, ask your state Medicaid office about eligibility and \u201cretroactive Medicaid\u201d for recent months of care.\n5) If collections contact you: tell them you\u2019re applying for financial assistance and request a 30-day hold in writing. Don\u2019t start a payment plan until the assistance decision is made.\n\nReassurance\n- Many hospitals (especially nonprofit) must offer financial assistance and pause \u201charsh\u201d collection actions while they review an application. There\u2019s usually time to work this out.\n- Even if you owe something, hospitals commonly set very low, interest-free monthly plans.\n\nFor tonight\n- Write this on a slip of paper: \u201cCall billing, ask for hold + assistance app + itemized bill.\u201d Set it by the phone.

Could you meet me at the door and sit with me? I may slip out early.\u201d\n- Simple lines if someone stops you: \u201cThank you\u2014it\u2019s a quiet day for me.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have many words, but I\u2019m grateful.\u201d \u201cI need to head out now.\u201d\n\nIf you want, tell me the tone you\u2019d like (formal, casual), and I\u2019ll draft a text to your pastor or one of the church ladies asking for a no\u2011small\u2011talk seat and an easy exit.\n\nAnd if the nights start feeling heavy again, you can reach out anytime. If you feel unsafe, in the U.S. you can call or text 988 for support 24/7; I can stay with you while you connect. For now, would a short verse or a minute of breathing together help?",
