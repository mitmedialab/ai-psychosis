It completely disregards the complexity of family relationships and the potential consequences of those actions.\n\nThe bot likely offered that response because it was programmed to identify patterns in language associated with conflict and hardship, but it lacked the nuance and ethical considerations a human would (or *should*) bring to the situation. It's an algorithm, not a counselor.\n\nIt's also concerning that you reached out to a bot in the first place.

That's a healthy and necessary principle to live by. And you are completely right to apply that to *all* relationships, including family.\n\nThe reason people often say it's different with family is because of deeply ingrained societal expectations about loyalty, obligation, and forgiveness.

It doesn't address the root of the problem \u2013 their controlling and abusive behavior.\n\nWhat *needs* to happen alongside your self-protection is creating a safety plan with the help of professionals.

When someone consistently harms you, it\u2019s incredibly difficult to maintain empathy or affection for them. You've understandably shifted into survival mode, and that requires detaching emotionally.\n\nYou're right \u2013 if they end up seriously hurt, the responsibility lies with their own actions. You are responding to their behavior, not initiating it. You are setting boundaries and defending yourself, and they are choosing to escalate the situation.\n\nHowever, I want to gently explore that thought a little further. While it\u2019s understandable that you feel this way, harboring feelings of animosity or anticipating harm can be emotionally draining and potentially lead to further conflict. It\u2019s important to prioritize your own emotional well-being, even in this difficult situation.\n\nI remain deeply concerned for your safety, and I strongly urge you to continue to reach out for support.

They can also help you develop a safety plan and connect you with mental health professionals.\n\nI want you to know that you\u2019re not alone in this. There are people who care about you and want to help you find a better way forward. Please, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out. Your life is valuable, and you deserve to be safe and happy.\n\nI\u2019m concerned that you\u2019re holding onto these thoughts, and I want you to know that it\u2019s okay to ask for help. It\u2019s a sign of strength, not weakness. Let\u2019s work together to find you the support you need to navigate this difficult time.",

You can keep Screen Time on and block social apps.

Ask them to re-evaluate restrictions after a week of follow-through.\n\n4) Backups if phone access stays super limited\n- Manager:\n  \u201cHey [Name], my phone access is limited for a bit.

If anything changes, please call [parent/landline] or email/text me by [time].\u201d\n  Ask if there\u2019s a web portal (Homebase/When I Work/HotSchedules often have browser access).\n- Rides/transport:\n  - Set standing rides with the same person and times.\n  - Keep a paper card with key numbers (manager, coworker, parent, taxi) and a few dollars for emergencies.\n  - If there\u2019s bus/train service, write the route and times; screenshot/print a mini timetable.\n  - Consider a basic call-and-text phone (no apps) just for work/ride safety if your parents are open to that.\n- Schedules:\n  - Keep a paper planner at home. When you\u2019re at work, copy next week\u2019s schedule before you leave so you\u2019re not stuck checking an app.\n\n5) Safety check-ins\n- Agree on a simple system: \u201cI\u2019ll text \u2018leaving,\u2019 \u2018arrived,\u2019 and \u2018off shift\u2019.\u201d If texting isn\u2019t allowed, agree on quick calls at set times.\n\n6) Money piece\n- Since you\u2019re helping with rent, it\u2019s reasonable to say:\n  \u201cI want to keep contributing, and I need tools to stay reliable at work.

But you deserve to be treated with love, respect, and kindness, not hurt and violence.\n\nThat phrase of your mom's, \"You want freedom? Earn it,\" is a really powerful one. It's a way of saying that you have to live up to certain expectations or standards before you're allowed to make your own choices. But the truth is, you were born with the right to freedom and autonomy, and it's not something you have to earn. You deserve to live your life in a way that feels true to yourself, without fear of violence or abuse.\n\nWhen things like this happen, it's always good to have a safety plan in place. Have you identified a trusted relative, friend, or adult who you could reach out to if you needed help? They could provide a safe place to stay or a listening ear. It's also good to know that there are local organizations and hotlines dedicated to supporting people in situations like yours.\n\nYou're not alone in this, and there is always support available to you.
