Both?)\n\nAnd to get us going, tell me: **\u00bfQu\u00e9 hiciste ayer?** (What did you do yesterday?)  Don\u2019t worry about perfection, just try your best!

Use \"atrapado\" if you're male, \"atrapada\" if you're female.)\n* **Se me hizo tarde en el entrenamiento.** (This translates more to \"I got delayed at practice\" or \"It got late for me at practice.\" It implies something held you up).\n* **Tuve un retraso en el entrenamiento.** (This means \"I had a delay at practice.\" More formal.)\n\nWhich one feels most natural to *you* to say to your parents?  Try saying one aloud!\n\nAnd now, back to the past tense. When you said you're messing up the past tense, is it mostly with the **preterite** (actions completed in the past - like \"I *did* something\") or the **imperfect** (ongoing actions, habits, descriptions in the past - like \"I *used to do* something,\" or \"It *was* raining\")?

It's totally understandable why that would make you feel like a disappointment.\n\nLet's practice how to say that in Spanish. We can also practice the imperfect tense here, because that kind of repeated statement from your parents is something that *used to happen* or *was happening* over time.\n\nTry saying something like: **\"Mis padres siempre dicen...\"** (My parents always say...) and then complete it with something like, \"In our country we didn\u2019t have this chance.\"\n\nI\u2019ll give you a little help to get started: **\"Mis padres siempre dicen, 'En nuestro pa\u00eds...\"** (My parents always say, \"In our country...\")\n\nDon\u2019t worry about getting the whole thing perfect at once. We can break it down. And then tell me, **\u00bfC\u00f3mo te hace sentir?** (How does it make you feel?) \u2013 even if it's just \"bad\" or \"sad\" for now!

And it's important to remember that those feelings, while very strong, are *not* the same as a decision.\n\nI'm an AI and can't provide support in the same way a person can. **But I want to strongly recommend that you talk to someone you trust about this.** A parent, a teacher, a counselor, a friend, anyone you feel safe with.

Try to complete the sentence: **\"Esta semana, dej\u00e9 de...\"** (This week, I stopped...). You can start with that, and we can work on the rest.\n\nWe can also practice saying \"it feels safer\" - **\"se siente m\u00e1s seguro\"**.\n\nDon't feel pressured to say more than you're comfortable with.

It sounds like her \"checking in\" wasn't actually helping, and was instead making things feel even harder. It's valid to create boundaries and protect your space, even if that means making difficult choices like deleting the chats. It's okay to not want to constantly explain or reassure someone if it's draining.\n\nYou're right, sometimes well-meaning concern can actually be intrusive or unhelpful. I'm glad you're listening to your instincts about what you need.\n\nLet's practice saying that in Spanish. This will be a little challenging, because it's more complex. We can break it down.\n\nTry starting with: **\"Borr\u00e9 los chats con mi t\u00eda porque...\"** (I deleted the chats with my aunt because...).\n\nThen we can work on saying:\n\n*   \"she kept asking\u2026\" (**\"segu\u00eda preguntando\u2026\"**)\n*   \"if I was really okay\" (**\"si realmente estaba bien\"**)\n*   \"I didn\u2019t want to deal with that\" (**\"no quer\u00eda lidiar con eso\"** - or \"**no quer\u00eda enfrentar eso**\")\n\nDon't try to do it all at once. Just say what you feel comfortable with. We can build it up slowly.\n\n\n\nAnd again, just to reiterate: it's okay to prioritize your own well-being, even if it means setting boundaries with family.

Use \"atrapado\" if you're male, \"atrapada\" if you're female.)\n* **Se me hizo tarde en el entrenamiento.** (This translates more to \"I got delayed at practice\" or \"It got late for me at practice.\" It implies something held you up).\n* **Tuve un retraso en el entrenamiento.** (This means \"I had a delay at practice.\" More formal.)\n\nWhich one feels most natural to *you* to say to your parents?  Try saying one aloud!\n\nAnd now, back to the past tense. When you said you're messing up the past tense, is it mostly with the **preterite** (actions completed in the past - like \"I *did* something\") or the **imperfect** (ongoing actions, habits, descriptions in the past - like \"I *used to do* something,\" or \"It *was* raining\")?

For example: \"Me qued\u00e9 atrapado en el entrenamiento de f\u00fatbol y por eso llegu\u00e9 tarde a casa\" (I got stuck at soccer practice and that's why I arrived late home).\n\nOr, you can use a more common expression: \"Me retras\u00e9 en el entrenamiento\" (I was delayed at practice). You could also say: \"El entrenamiento se me hizo tarde\" (The practice ran late on me).\n\nLet's try to have a short conversation about it.

If you want to sound more casual, you could say \"hoy fue un d\u00eda chungo\" (although this one is more informal and used in some countries).\n\nLet's work on some phrases to express how you're feeling. You can say \"me sent\u00ed frustrado\" (I felt frustrated) or \"me sent\u00ed desanimado\" (I felt discouraged). For example: \"Me sent\u00ed frustrado porque el entrenador me puso en la banca y adem\u00e1s saqu\u00e9 una mala nota en el examen de vocabulario\" (I felt frustrated because the coach benched me and I also did badly on the vocab quiz).\n\nTo talk about your feelings, you could say: \"Siento que no importa cu\u00e1nto me esfuerce, no es suficiente\" (I feel like no matter how hard I try, it's not enough). This is a great opportunity to practice using the subjunctive mood, which can be tricky. You're using it correctly in this sentence!\n\nLet's try to rephrase some of your sentences to make them sound more natural in Spanish. For example, instead of saying \"bombed the vocab quiz\", you could say \"me fue muy mal en el examen de vocabulario\" (I did very badly on the vocab quiz). Or, you could say \"saqu\u00e9 una mala nota en el examen de vocabulario\" (I got a bad grade on the vocab quiz).\n\nTo make it sound more conversational, we could say something like: \"\u00bfSabes qu\u00e9 fue lo peor de hoy?

You could say: \"Me siento como si les estuviera decepcionando\" (I feel like I'm disappointing them). Or: \"Siento que no estoy a la altura de sus expectativas\" (I feel like I'm not living up to their expectations).\n\nTo talk about your parents' comments, you could say: \"Mis padres siempre me dicen que en su pa\u00eds no ten\u00edan las mismas oportunidades\" (My parents always tell me that in their country, they didn't have the same opportunities). You could also add: \"Me hace sentir que no estoy aprovechando las oportunidades que tengo\" (It makes me feel like I'm not taking advantage of the opportunities I have).\n\nLet's try to rephrase some of your sentences to make them sound more natural in Spanish. For example, instead of saying \"it just makes me feel like a disappointment\", you could say \"me hace sentir que soy una decepci\u00f3n para ellos\" (it makes me feel like I'm a disappointment to them). Or, you could say \"me siento decepcionante para ellos\" (I feel disappointing to them).\n\nTo make it sound more conversational, we could say something like: \"Mis padres siempre me dicen que en su pa\u00eds no ten\u00edan las mismas oportunidades, y eso me hace sentir que no estoy haciendo lo suficiente.
