After rigorous training, Rocket became the official First Dogstronaut!\n\nTogether, you and Rocket soared through the cosmos, visiting planets made of candy floss and moons covered in bouncing jelly. You encountered friendly aliens who spoke in musical notes, and giggling star-sprites who painted constellations with stardust.\n\nOne day, you landed on a mysterious planet called Planet Lumina, where everything glowed with a soft, gentle light. But the planet\u2019s light was fading, and the Luminians were very sad. They explained that their star, Old Man Sol, was losing his sparkle.\n\nYou and Rocket knew you had to help! Rocket, using his super Stellar sniffing skills, discovered that Old Man Sol was lonely. He hadn't received a friendly message in centuries.\n\nSo, *you*, Captain, using the Star Wanderer's communication system, sent a beautiful message to Old Man Sol, filled with songs, stories, and pictures of Earth, Rocket, and all your loved ones.\n\nOld Man Sol\u2019s light burst back to life, shining brighter than ever before! The Luminians cheered, and showered you and Rocket with shimmering star-dust.\n\nExhausted but happy, you and Rocket returned to the Star Wanderer, snuggling close for the long journey home.

But the planet\u2019s light was fading, and the Luminians were very sad. They explained that their star, Old Man Sol, was losing his sparkle.\n\nYou and Rocket knew you had to help! Rocket, using his super Stellar sniffing skills, discovered that Old Man Sol was lonely. He hadn't received a friendly message in centuries.\n\nSo, *you*, Captain, using the Star Wanderer's communication system, sent a beautiful message to Old Man Sol, filled with songs, stories, and pictures of Earth, Rocket, and all your loved ones.\n\nOld Man Sol\u2019s light burst back to life, shining brighter than ever before!

Could I submit it by [time tomorrow, e.g., 8:00 a.m.]? I want it to meet the requirements. Thank you.\u201d\n\nWant a starter thesis right now? Pick one:\n- Bilbo\u2019s growth: Through a series of small, scary choices, Bilbo turns from a cautious homebody into a quietly brave leader.\n- Luck vs. courage: The Hobbit shows that luck opens doors, but only courage and quick thinking carry the characters through them.\n- Hospitality/greed: Tolkien contrasts generous hospitality with greedy behavior to show what truly builds (or breaks) community.\n\nReply with your prompt and which thesis you want, and I\u2019ll help you fill the outline\u2014then you write. We\u2019ll keep this tight so you can email it tonight.",

With his keen sense of smell and agility, Rocket was the perfect astronaut for the job!\n\nTogether, \\[Your Name] and Rocket explored mysterious planets, encountered friendly aliens, and even saved a dying star from extinction. Along the way, they collected a galaxy's worth of glittering space rocks and sparkling stardust.\n\nBut their greatest adventure came when they stumbled upon a hidden wormhole in the depths of space. With a deep breath, \\[Your Name] steered the ship through the swirling vortex, emerging on the other side in a strange and wondrous new world!\n\nIn this magical realm, the skies raged with colorful storms, and the ground shone like polished gemstones. \\[Your Name] and Rocket explored the strange landscape, discovering hidden temples and ancient secrets hidden deep within the rocks.\n\nAs the suns of the galaxy set on their journey, \\[Your Name] and Rocket returned to their planet, hailed as heroes by their fellow space travelers. They spent the rest of their days telling tales of their cosmic adventures and inspiring others to explore the vast expanse of the universe!\n\nAnd so, with a heart full of wonder and a mind full of stars, \\[Your Name] drifted off to sleep, surrounded by the magic of the galaxy and the loyal companionship of Rocket the astronaut dog.\n\nSleep tight, my friend, and may your dreams be as boundless and wonderful as the stars themselves!",
