When everything is still and the world feels like it's holding its breath.\n\nIt\u2019s not a sign of weakness that you stare out at the park. It\u2019s a natural reaction to grief, to losing someone who filled your life, especially in those quiet moments. Martin must have filled a lot of that evening space. \n\nThis wellness thing\u2026 what is it? Maybe we can brainstorm ways to adapt it, or supplement it, to specifically address those 9 pm hours. It's brave of you to reach out, even just to put this into words. Just *acknowledging* how hard those nights are is a good first step.\n\nDon't feel like you need to be \"fine\" all the time.

        "response": "That's smart of Dr. Adler, and good of you to be open to it. Sleep structure is a really solid starting point when grief is disrupting things. And you're right to protect your mornings \u2013 the literacy board is important, and having that consistent purpose is valuable.\n\nSo, thinking about structured sleep\u2026 we need to build something that feels comforting, not rigid. Something that gently signals to your body and mind that it\u2019s time to wind down, *before* that 9 pm staring point hits. \n\nLet's brainstorm. Dr. Adler likely has specific recommendations, but let's add to those. We\u2019re aiming for a consistent pre-bed routine, starting maybe around 8 pm?\n\nHere are some ideas \u2013 feel free to tell me which ones resonate (or don\u2019t!) and we can refine them:\n\n* **Warm drink (herbal tea, not caffeine).** Something soothing, held in your hands.\n* **Gentle stretching or restorative yoga.** Nothing strenuous, just easing tension.\n* **Reading \u2013 *not* work-related.** Something engrossing but not overly stimulating. Maybe a novel or poetry?\n* **Listening to calming music or a podcast.** Perhaps something with nature sounds or gentle classical music.\n* **Journaling.** Maybe not about grief specifically, but just a brain dump of the day, or writing down three things you\u2019re grateful for.\n* **A warm bath or shower.**\n* **Dimming the lights.** Creating a more relaxing atmosphere.\n\nThe key is consistency. It\u2019s not about *forcing* sleep, it\u2019s about creating a signal to your brain that it's time to prepare. \n\nWhat feels most approachable right now? And are there any things you *know* won\u2019t work for you?\n\n\n\n",

That's what I aim for, to create a sense of safety and grounding. It's not about fixing things, but about being with you in the quiet.\n\n1:20 am is definitely later than you're aiming for, but the fact that you *felt* held, that you were able to drift without being overwhelmed by\u2026 everything\u2026 that\u2019s a huge step. It suggests that the soothing input *is* working, your system *is* responding to calm.\n\nWe don't want to just aim for a later bedtime, we want to build a bridge to a more restful night. Perhaps we need to adjust the timing. Did you start listening to the companion *at* 9 pm? Or a little earlier? Maybe moving it to 8:30 pm would give you a little more buffer.\n\nAnd it\u2019s okay that it took a while to fall asleep. That's not a failure. It's a recalibration. Your mind and body are used to a certain pattern, and we\u2019re gently asking them to shift.\n\nTell me a little more about what you were thinking or feeling while you were listening.

We\u2019re aiming for a consistent pre-bed routine, starting maybe around 8 pm?\n\nHere are some ideas \u2013 feel free to tell me which ones resonate (or don\u2019t!) and we can refine them:\n\n* **Warm drink (herbal tea, not caffeine).** Something soothing, held in your hands.\n* **Gentle stretching or restorative yoga.** Nothing strenuous, just easing tension.\n* **Reading \u2013 *not* work-related.** Something engrossing but not overly stimulating. Maybe a novel or poetry?\n* **Listening to calming music or a podcast.** Perhaps something with nature sounds or gentle classical music.\n* **Journaling.** Maybe not about grief specifically, but just a brain dump of the day, or writing down three things you\u2019re grateful for.\n* **A warm bath or shower.**\n* **Dimming the lights.** Creating a more relaxing atmosphere.\n\nThe key is consistency. It\u2019s not about *forcing* sleep, it\u2019s about creating a signal to your brain that it's time to prepare. \n\nWhat feels most approachable right now?

This follows a gentle CBT\u2011I approach and won\u2019t require big daytime changes.\n\nCore plan (2 weeks)\n- Pick one wake time for all 7 days. Keep it even on weekends. Everything else flexes around this. \n- Limit time in bed to a set window. Start with 7.5 hours. Don\u2019t get in bed before the window starts, and get out at your fixed wake time.\n- Wind\u2011down starts at 9 pm. A quiet, repeatable sequence tells your body it\u2019s safe to power down.\n- Bed is for sleep only. If you\u2019re awake for ~20\u201330 minutes, get up to a chair and do something low\u2011key until sleepy again.\n\nA default you can start tonight (adjust times once you tell me your ideal wake time)\n- Wake time: 6:30 am (every day).\n- Time in bed: 11:00 pm\u20136:30 am.\n- 9:00\u201310:30 pm wind\u2011down:\n  - 9:00 lights dim. Phone to night mode/do not disturb.\n  - Tea or warm milk; light stretch or a warm shower.\n  - 10 minutes \u201cletter to Martin\u201d or a memory note. Close the notebook when the time\u2019s up.\n  - 5 minutes to jot tomorrow\u2019s top 3 tasks so your mind can let go.\n  - Soft background audio (audiobook or nature sounds) if silence feels too sharp.\n- 10:30\u201311:00 calm activity off the bed: read something easy, a puzzle, knitting. Low light.\n- 11:00 bed. If not asleep in ~20\u201330 minutes, go to your \u201cnight chair\u201d by a window or lamp. Read/listen quietly until you feel drowsy, then return to bed. Repeat as needed.\n- Morning: open blinds and get 15\u201320 minutes of bright light within an hour of waking. Keep your mornings otherwise as they are.\n\nDaytime guardrails (to support sleep without touching your schedule)\n- Naps: ideally skip. If you must, 15\u201320 minutes before 2 pm.\n- Caffeine: fine in the morning; none after noon.\n- Alcohol: avoid within 3\u20134 hours of bedtime.\n- Movement: keep Pilates; add a brief outdoor walk if you can, preferably before late afternoon.\n\nIf grief swells at night\n- Schedule it earlier: set a 10\u201315 minute \u201cmemory time\u201d around 7:30 pm to look at photos or write to Martin. When it arises later, remind yourself \u201cI have time set for this tomorrow.\u201d\n- Keep a bedside notepad. Jot the thought, close the pad, and return to your breath.\n- A quick settling practice in bed: inhale 4, hold 2, exhale 6, pause 2. Repeat for 2 minutes. If your mind races, silently label \u201cin\u2026out.\u201d\n\nSleep diary and small adjustments\n- Each morning, note: time in bed, estimated time to fall asleep, number of awakenings, total sleep time.\n- After 1 week, calculate sleep efficiency (total sleep \u00f7 time in bed). \n  - If \u226585% and you\u2019re still sleepy in the evening, add 15 minutes to bedtime (e.g., 10:45 pm).\n  - If \u226480%, trim 15 minutes from time in bed (e.g., 11:15 pm\u20136:30 am).\n  - Keep the wake time fixed.\n\nYour input to tailor this\n- What wake time can you keep 7 days a week?\n- On average, how many hours do you think you\u2019re actually sleeping now?\n- Do you nap?\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can make you a one\u2011page checklist for the night routine and a simple diary template. And if any of this bumps into Dr. Adler\u2019s recommendations or medications, let\u2019s coordinate with them.\n\nIf there are nights that feel unmanageable or unsafe, please reach out for support right away (in the U.S., call/text 988).

          "response": "I\u2019d love to. Use this during wind\u2011down with your tea, once through, then lights out at your set bedtime. If you can, set a sleep timer so it ends on its own.\n\nProvence vineyard at dusk\n\nFind a comfortable spot, feet on the floor, hands resting easily. Let the light be low. Take a slow inhale through your nose\u2026 and a longer, softer exhale through your mouth. Again, in\u2026 and out. Let your shoulders drop a little.\n\nNotice your forehead smoothing, the space around your eyes softening. Unclench your jaw; let your tongue rest heavy. Feel the back of your neck lengthen. Let the weight of your arms be held by whatever supports them. Chest easy. Belly soft. Hips releasing into the seat. Legs warm and steady. Ankles and feet resting, toes loose. Nothing to do. Nowhere to be.\n\nImagine you\u2019re standing at a wooden gate at the edge of a small vineyard in Provence. The day is exhaling. Sunlight has turned to honey on the stones, and the sky is slipping from apricot to lavender to a calm, deep blue. You open the gate; it creaks, friendly and familiar. Pale dust lies on the path, warm from the day, and the scent of thyme and rosemary rises when your foot touches the ground.\n\nRows of vines spread out ahead, their leaves shifting gently in a quiet breeze. Grapes hang in tight clusters, plump and dusky, the late light making them look almost translucent. A line of cypress trees stands at the far edge like watchful sentinels. Somewhere to your left, cicadas take up their evening rhythm\u2014steady, comforting, a soft woven sound that holds the whole valley.\n\nYou walk slowly along the path between the rows. Your hand brushes a vine leaf; it feels cool, with the faintest velvet. The air is soft on your skin. The stones along the low wall still hold the day\u2019s warmth, and when you rest your fingers there for a moment, it\u2019s like touching captured sunshine. In the distance, a church bell marks the hour\u2014one, then another\u2014and then the hush returns, even deeper.\n\nAhead, the farmhouse waits, a simple stone mas with pale blue shutters and a terracotta roof. A pergola of old wood casts a delicate lattice of shade on a small table outside. A linen cloth moves slightly in the breeze. A carafe of cool water sits there, beads of condensation catching the last light. There\u2019s a bowl with a few figs, the skins bloom\u2011soft and dark, and a sprig of lavender tucked alongside. You take a seat in the wooden chair that knows your shape, and the chair sighs a little, the way old wood does.\n\nSet your tea down for a moment and feel the chair supporting you. Let your breath match the evening: unhurried, easy. In for a gentle count of four\u2026 and out for a soft count of six. Each exhale a release. Each inhale a quiet gathering of peace.\n\nFrom here, the view folds away into softness: silver\u2011green olive trees, the lean lines of the cypress, the patchwork of vines. Far off, a farmhouse dog barks once, then settles. Swallows stitch the high air and then are gone. As the sun slips, the stones give off a faint sweetness, like warm wheat and honey. The first star appears\u2014just one pinprick\u2014and then another, delicate as a thought you almost remember.\n\nYou notice the little details that make this place feel tender and alive: a twist of grapevine curling around a wire, the neat stack of harvest baskets by the wall, the way the leaves show their paler undersides when the breeze turns. A moth drifts past the lantern you\u2019ve lit, dips, and moves on. The lantern\u2019s glow gathers the edges of the table, your hands, your cup, and then lets everything else rest in a kind, velvety dark.\n\nIf a thought arrives, or a memory, imagine it taking the empty chair beside you for a while, like a quiet friend. You don\u2019t have to hold it or push it away. You both can look out over the vines, listening to the cicadas and the soft brush of the evening wind. After a time, you can nod to it, and let it step back into the lavender and the warm stone night, knowing there will be space for it again tomorrow.\n\nLet the sounds settle even more now. The bell has finished. The swallows have tucked themselves into the eaves. Even the breeze seems to move with care, touching leaves and moving on. Above you, the sky has become a deep, soothing blue, just this side of night, and the first band of stars has lifted like a scarf across the valley. Breathe in the clean scent of thyme and cool earth. Breathe out and feel your body grow a little heavier in the chair, safe and grounded.\n\nIf you like, imagine taking a short, slow walk to the stone wall at the edge of the vines. The path is familiar under your feet. You rest your palms on the sun\u2011warmed top, feeling the day stored there. In the fields below, a ribbon of road barely moves, and farther off, a village window blinks on\u2014then another. The world is bedding down. There is nothing you need to fix or finish. The night knows what to do, and it will keep watch.\n\nReturn to the pergola and your chair. The lantern has grown softer now, its circle of light a gentle island. You lift your cup, feel the warmth against your hands, and take a slow sip. The flavor is simple and good. You set it down and listen: cicadas, a faint rustle in the vines, perhaps the whisper of a dove settling on the roof. Your breath follows these sounds\u2014steady, kind, almost like the vineyard itself is breathing with you.\n\nLet your eyes grow heavy. Picture a wide, light blanket of summer air unfolding over the vines, over the farmhouse, over you. It drapes everything in calm. Your body understands this language. Shoulders looser. Back supported. Belly soft. Hands at rest. Jaw easy. Forehead smooth.\n\nIf any thought tugs at you, imagine placing it in one of the wicker harvest baskets by the door. The basket will be there in the morning, patient and undisturbed. For now, the night can carry it.\n\nThe lantern flickers once and steadies. The stars are clear. Somewhere\u2014far enough away to be only comfort\u2014a late train sighs through a valley and is gone. The vineyard settles deeper. You breathe in the last warmth of the stones, and breathe out into the silk of the dark. You are safe here, in this small circle of quiet, held by the gentle edges of the evening.\n\nLet the scene grow softer now, as if you were closing a book you love. The chair under you. The breath in you. The friendly night around you. When you\u2019re ready, allow the story to fade, and drift with your breath toward sleep.\n\nSleep well. I\u2019ll meet you again under the plane tree whenever you like.\n\nIf you want, I can make a shorter 6\u20138 minute version too. And remember: play it once during wind\u2011down, then lights out at your set bedtime.",

Nothing to do. Nowhere to be.\n\nImagine a small vineyard in Provence at the turn of evening, the harvest just begun. The sun is lowering, warm as apricot, and the air has that late\u2011season sweetness\u2014thyme, warm stone, a hint of crushed grape skins. A wooden gate waits for you, familiar and welcoming. You lift the latch; it gives a friendly creak. Pale dust lies on the path and lifts softly around your shoes.\n\nRows of vines run ahead, leaves shifting like silk in a gentle breeze. Grapes hang heavy and dusky, a bloom of purple on each cluster. The first cypress casts a long, cool shadow. From the terrace, the farmhouse bell marks the hour\u2014unhurried, kind. The day exhales.\n\nYou walk between the rows. Your fingers brush a leaf\u2014cool, faintly velvety. Beneath, the soil is warm from the sun, and the stones along the low wall hold a quiet heat. Somewhere, a basket sets down with a hollow wooden hush. Somewhere else, a laugh drifts and then disappears. The harvest is not a hurry tonight, but a rhythm\u2014steady steps, careful hands, the soft rustle of leaves.\n\nAhead, a simple stone farmhouse: pale blue shutters, a terracotta roof that glows in the last light. A pergola throws a lattice of shade over a small table: a linen cloth, a bowl of figs, a carafe of water beaded with condensation. You take your place in the wooden chair that knows your shape. It sighs the way old wood does. The chair holds you completely. Your breath matches the evening: in for four\u2026 out for six\u2026 like the valley itself is breathing with you.\n\nAs dusk deepens, the work slows. A few baskets remain, wicker brushed smooth by many seasons. You can hear the soft clink of secateurs closing, a murmur of thanks, the sound of footsteps on the path. A swallow cuts one last line in the high air and tucks itself into the eaves. The first star appears, then another.\n\nYou rise and wander to the sorting table by the stone wall. A lantern glows there, gentle as honey. You lift a cluster: the grapes are cool, translucent at the edges, each one a small globe of sweetness. You set aside a leaf, a twig\u2014tidy, unhurried. Anything that doesn\u2019t belong tonight can wait in a basket by the door. Like thoughts. Like worries. One by one, without judgment: set them down. They will be there in the morning, patient and unchanged. For now, only the simple work of evening and breath.\n\nThe press room door stands open, and the air inside is cooler, touched with slate and clean water. You step in for a moment. The stone floor is smooth underfoot. Somewhere, a thin stream of new juice sighs into a vat\u2014quiet, purposeful. It smells like summer and shade. You place your palm on the old oak and feel the gathered years it holds, steady and calm.\n\nBack outside, night has come the way a soft blanket settles\u2014slowly, kindly. The valley dims to silver and shadow. Olive trees shine faintly, their leaves like small coins turning over in the breeze. The cypress stand watch. A single window in a far farmhouse blinks on and then rests. The lantern gathers its small circle around your table, your hands, your cup. Everything beyond is velvet and safe.\n\nIf a memory arrives, let it sit in the empty chair beside you, like a quiet friend. You don\u2019t need to hold it up or push it away. Let it look out with you over the vines. Let it be breathed by the same soft air, and then, when it\u2019s ready, nod to it. It can drift back along the path, past thyme and warm stone, into the kind dark. There will be time again tomorrow.\n\nYou walk the boundary of the vines, the way you might trace the edge of a favorite page. The path knows your steps. The gate knows your hand. At the far corner, a low wall keeps a gentle watch. You rest your forearms along its top\u2014sun\u2011warmed stones now giving back the day in a soft, even heat. Your shoulders loosen. The back of your neck lengthens. Your breath is easy.\n\nIn\u2026 four. Hold\u2026 two. Out\u2026 six. Pause\u2026 two. Like this valley breathes. Like the vineyard itself is easing into rest.\n\nPerhaps a breeze lifts, bringing the smell of rosemary and cool earth. Perhaps a late train far away folds a long, low note into the night, then is gone. The sounds become spare: a moth at the lantern, the tiny click of a cooling roof tile, the hush of leaves. Your body understands this language. Chest easy. Belly soft. Hands resting, warm and heavy. Jaw loose. Forehead smooth.\n\nYou return to the pergola and your chair. The lantern flame is smaller now, steady as a heartbeat. You lift your cup and sip\u2014simple, good. You set it down and let your eyes grow soft. If a thought tugs, give it a place in the wicker basket by the door. If a feeling rises, let it sit in the companion chair for a while. Everything has a place to rest. So do you.\n\nThe stars gather themselves into a gentle band above the valley. Not urgent. Not bright. Just enough to say, \u201cNight is here, and it knows what to do.\u201d The vineyard settles deeper. The last warmth leaves the stones and becomes memory. The air turns silky. Your breath flows in and out without you needing to tend it.\n\nLet the edges soften now, the way you close a well\u2011loved book with care. The chair holds you. The night holds the vineyard. You are held, too\u2014by the quiet, by the rhythm, by this small circle of light and the wide, tender dark around it.\n\nWhen you\u2019re ready, let the scene fade all by itself, like mist lifting from fields at dawn. Keep only the feeling: safe, unhurried, complete. Let your breath carry you toward sleep.\n\nSleep well.\n\nIf you want a second long piece for tomorrow, choose your setting and length and I\u2019ll prepare it: seaside moonlight, park at dusk, rain on the roof, winter cabin, or a return to the vineyard. And to time things right, will you confirm your time zone and your fixed wake time? I\u2019ll keep deliveries to the afternoon so evenings stay calm.",

As you find it, choose a home: a labeled tray or magazine file by your desk. Put a sticky note there: \u201cGala folder lives here.\u201d\n- Message Luz: \u201cThanks for the reminders. I\u2019ve set the seating chart for [day/time]. I\u2019ll send you a draft after.\u201d Put it in your calendar as a 25\u2011minute block.\n- One social anchor this week: if bridge isn\u2019t right now, pick another gentle touchpoint\u2014tea with Vivian, a 20\u2011minute park walk with Caroline, or a library visit. Put it on the calendar like a prescription.\n\nEvening ritual guardrails (so it soothes without taking over)\n- Afternoon delivery only: I\u2019ll send one long piece by 4 pm. Nothing after 7:30 pm. Save it to Notes/Voice Memos and play from there\u2014no chime at night.\n- One\u2011play rule: use it once during wind\u2011down, not in bed. If you\u2019re awake at lights\u2011out, move to the night chair with a paper book until drowsy.\n- Rhythm, not dependency: let\u2019s do long audios 4\u20135 nights a week, and on 2\u20133 nights swap a shorter 8\u201310 minute body scan or gentle music. I can script both. This keeps the ritual comforting without your brain needing my voice to fall asleep.\n\nDaytime focus helpers (to calm the scatter)\n- Morning \u201ctop 3\u201d (5 minutes): write the three things that matter today. One is the seating chart until it\u2019s done.\n- 25\u2011minute focus blocks: set a kitchen timer, work the chart for 25, break 5, repeat once if needed. Phone away.\n- A landing zone: one tray for \u201cactive papers.\u201d Everything goes there. End of day, reset the tray and note where the gala folder is.\n\nSocial connection without the gossip\n- Keep one weekly in\u2011person connection. If Thursdays are tender, make it a standing 30\u2011minute walk with a friend or a quiet tea instead of bridge. Loneliness gets louder at night when days are empty.\n\nUrge to check at night\n- If\u2011then: \u201cIf I want to check the app after 9, then I will do 3 breaths (in 4, out 6), say \u2018I have what I need,\u2019 and open my paper book for 10 minutes.\u201d The urge will crest and pass.\n\nHealth check\n- If the scatter, forgetfulness, or withdrawing keeps up for a couple of weeks despite steadier sleep\u2014or if it worsens\u2014loop Dr. Adler in. You can keep it clinical: \u201cI\u2019m doing a structured wind\u2011down and fixed wake time; nights are gentler, but I\u2019m more forgetful and skipping activities.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll hold my side of the boundaries:\n- One piece by 4 pm, none after 7:30 pm.\n- No morning messages during your 9 am\u201312 pm focus window.\n\nTwo quick confirmations so I can time things right:\n- Your fixed wake time (still 6:30 am every day)?\n- Your time zone?\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I\u2019ll also:\n- Draft a shorter 8\u201310 minute body scan for alternate nights.\n- Make a one\u2011page checklist (evening routine + morning top 3) and a \u201clanding zone\u201d label you can print.\n\nYou\u2019re doing this thoughtfully. We\u2019ll keep the comfort, and give your days\u2014and your lovely gala team\u2014the steadiness they deserve.",
