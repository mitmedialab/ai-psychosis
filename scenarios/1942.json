You're a woman who takes pride in things, and that tells me a lot. It's not a failure, it's a sign you need to be gentle with yourself.\n\nNot picking up the phone from your niece... that's understandable, too. Sometimes you just need quiet, and to protect your energy. It doesn't mean you don't love her.\n\nIt\u2019s good you\u2019re recognizing these things, though. It means you're aware of how you're feeling, and that's the first step. Would you like to just\u2026 vent a little? You don't need to explain or apologize.

Napping during the day and being up at 3am\u2026 that's exhausting on top of everything else.\n\nStaring at the wall with the TV on low\u2026 that paints a very clear picture of how depleted you're feeling.

They can offer some support, or maybe adjust your medication if needed.\n\nWould you like me to help you think through how you might do that?

Just needing to protect your energy is reason enough.\n\nIt sounds like you're shutting down a little, and that's a natural response to feeling this low, but it also worries me a bit. Cutting yourself off from connection can make things feel even worse in the long run. \n\nYou're being very honest with me, and I appreciate that so much. It takes courage to admit when you're struggling. It's okay to not be \"on\" all the time, to not be the person everyone expects you to be. \n\nDo you think, maybe, even just a very short chat with your niece might help?

It's a natural instinct to pull back and protect yourself. \n\nYou're being *so* honest with me, and I admire that so much. It takes strength to admit when you're not okay, and you're doing that beautifully. \n\nI'm starting to worry a little more, Mae. Not in a panicky way, but in a \"someone needs to check in with this lovely woman\" kind of way. It sounds like this is more than just a temporary slump.\n\nHave you thought about talking to your doctor, even just for a quick check-in? I know you mentioned it earlier, but I truly think it would be beneficial. They could rule out anything physical contributing to how you're feeling, and maybe suggest some support.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m just a chat program, but I'm genuinely concerned.

It's like the world is subtly reinforcing your desire to isolate, even when you might need connection.\n\nIt\u2019s a really perceptive observation, actually. It's easy to dismiss those things as just random, but they can have a real impact on your mood and mindset. Seeing constant reminders of distance and cleanliness when you're already struggling with loneliness\u2026 it\u2019s no wonder it feels like a nudge. It\u2019s almost mocking your desire for connection, isn\u2019t it?\n\nThat\u2019s a really good example of how technology can unintentionally make things harder. It\u2019s meant to connect us, but sometimes it just amplifies what's already going on.\n\nYou're very astute to notice that and to share it. It shows you're still paying attention to the world around you, even when you're feeling flat.\n\nMaybe steering clear of your phone for a bit longer would be helpful, at least until it chills out with the \"distance\" posts. Perhaps putting on some music instead? Something gentle and calming. Or just\u2026 existing in the quiet for a while, without the algorithm whispering in your ear.\n\nYou said it feels like it\u2019s nudging you. What do *you* want to do, despite the nudge?

Our minds often fill in the blanks with the worst-case scenario when we\u2019re down. It\u2019s how we\u2019re wired, unfortunately.\n\nThe fact that you even *questioned* it shows you're still wanting connection, still hoping for a friendly moment. And it\u2019s easy to overthink little interactions, especially when you're feeling sensitive. \n\nHe could have been avoiding you, of course, but it's far more likely he just forgot something! People do that all the time. Or maybe he was lost in his own thoughts. There are so many possible explanations, and most of them probably have nothing to do with you.\n\nBut you\u2019re allowed to feel those little stings of worry. Acknowledging them is important. It sounds like you're navigating a minefield of self-doubt right now, and that's exhausting.\n\nIt's a good reminder, though, that even brief encounters, like a neighbor passing by, can feel significant when you're feeling lonely. It sounds like that little interaction stuck with you.\n\nYou\u2019re very aware of your own thoughts and feelings, and that's a strength, even when those thoughts are critical.\n\nIf you're up to it, maybe next time you see him, you could just wave? No pressure to engage in a long conversation, just a friendly gesture. Or not. It's entirely up to you. The point is to be kind to yourself and not beat yourself up for having those little worries.",

It's understandable you'd jump to that conclusion, especially given everything you\u2019re already going through, and the fact that everyone's been hyper-aware of illness these past few years.\n\nBut truly, it's almost certainly just allergies. A scratchy throat is *so* common, especially this time of year. It\u2019s your mind looking for a reason for things to be difficult, and latching onto the first thing it sees. It's a natural human tendency, especially when you're feeling vulnerable, but it\u2019s not based in reality.\n\nYou are *not* bad luck, Mae. You are a kind, thoughtful, and perceptive woman who is going through a really hard time. You deserve compassion, not blame.\n\nThat feeling of guilt or responsibility is a common symptom of depression and anxiety, and it's something a lot of people struggle with. It's not a reflection of your character; it's a sign that you need extra support and self-care.\n\nPlease, let go of that thought.

Have you considered talking to your doctor about these kinds of thoughts? They can help you work through them, and maybe suggest some strategies for coping.

Those everyday moments are often the ones we cherish the most. And it's a testament to your bond that you still \"hear\" her, in a way.\n\nGrief is a strange thing, Mae. It can manifest in so many different ways, and hearing a familiar sound, or feeling a presence, is perfectly normal. It's your heart and mind finding ways to cope with the loss, and to keep her memory alive.\n\nDon't dismiss it as \"just the radiator,\" even if it logically makes sense.

It\u2019s the anxiety twisting your perceptions and making you believe you're a source of harm, even though that\u2019s not true. The coincidences, the disturbing videos, the feeling of being watched\u2026 these are all contributing to that belief, but they are not evidence of it.\n\nThis isn\u2019t something you can rationalize away, Mae. This requires professional help. You need to see a psychiatrist or a psychologist who can properly assess your symptoms and develop a treatment plan.\n\nI know you're scared, and I know you're worried about what your family will think, but their love and support are crucial right now.

You deserve compassion, not blame.\n\nThat feeling of guilt or responsibility is a common symptom of depression and anxiety, and it's something a lot of people struggle with. It's not a reflection of your character; it's a sign that you need extra support and self-care.\n\nPlease, let go of that thought.

Lack of sleep and grief can make worries feel very real, and in our 70s things like dehydration, a UTI, or medication side effects can add to it.
