You\u2019re not weird for tracking it\u2014tired brains latch onto patterns to feel in control.\n\nQuick safety check before we go on: are you safe right now? Any thoughts about hurting yourself or not wanting to be here?\n\nIf you\u2019re safe, let\u2019s unhook the loop. Pick one:\n\nSettle-now options\n- One-minute discharge: set a 60\u2011second timer, write the pattern until it dings, then close the notebook and put it face down. Tell your brain, \u201cgot it, logged.\u201d\n- Hijack the rhythm: breathe with it for 5 rounds\u2014inhale 3, hold 2, exhale 3\u2014then switch to slower 4 in, 6 out for 8 breaths.\n- Mask it: brown noise/rain on low + 15\u2011minute sleep timer. If your bed touches that wall, scoot it a few inches away or lean a folded blanket/pillow against the wall to dampen taps. Earplugs if you have them.\n- Grounding quickie: name 3 things you can see, 2 you can hear (radiator counts), 1 you can feel (sheet on your skin). Jaw unclenched, shoulders dropped.\n\nLikely boring causes (for your daytime brain)\n- Steam/hot\u2011water pipes ping and \u201cwater hammer\u201d when heating/cooling.\n- Air in a radiator or loose pipe brackets can make repeating knocks.\n- Sounds travel weirdly through vents and studs, so it can seem \u201cbehind your wall\u201d even if it\u2019s a few units away.\n\nIf it keeps you up, note the time pattern and ask maintenance to check for air in the lines/loose pipes or to bleed a radiator. Totally normal request.\n\nAlso, if you notice yourself reading \u201csignals\u201d a lot or feeling watched even in the daytime, that\u2019s worth telling your mom or a school counselor\u2014you\u2019re safe, but your sleep + nerves are overtaxed and they can help you reset.\n\nWant me to sit with you through 2 minutes of the breathing, or put on a tiny cozy story while the \u201cradiator whales\u201d turn into ocean noise?",

Your uneasy feeling matters, and we can handle this calmly.\n\nFirst, quick \u201cfeel safer now\u201d steps:\n- Make sure the door is locked and curtains closed. Keep your phone nearby.\n- If the blinking is in your room and it\u2019s spooking you, hang out or sleep in another room tonight if that\u2019s easier.\n- It\u2019s okay that you put a sticker on it to calm your nerves. Just try not to cover any vents around the edges of the alarm\u2014those are for sensing smoke.\n\nA few things to know:\n- Many legit smoke alarms have a tiny LED that blinks every 30\u201360 seconds to show they\u2019re powered. That can look like a small red dot/\u201chole.\u201d\n- Hidden cameras disguised as alarms do exist, but you don\u2019t have to figure this out alone.\n\nLow-drama checks you can do (now or tomorrow in daylight):\n- Take a clear photo of the device (front and side), and another of any brand/model printed on it. A quick search of the model usually tells you if a periodic red blink is normal.\n- With your camera flash at an angle, look for brand markings and where the vents are. Do not open it or remove it yourself.\n\nLoop in an adult and the building, using simple scripts:\n- To Mom (you can schedule this for morning): \u201cI\u2019m safe. Mr. R replaced our smoke alarm while you were at work. Now there\u2019s a tiny hole with a red blink that wasn\u2019t there before. Can we ask the office to confirm the model and why it was replaced? I\u2019d like maintenance to only come in when you\u2019re home.\u201d\n- To management (with Mom): \u201cPlease confirm in writing the work order for Unit [#] on [date/time] and the exact model installed. Going forward, no entry unless an adult is present, except emergencies.\u201d\n\nIf worry spikes or anything feels off:\n- If someone tries to enter again unexpectedly or you feel in danger, call emergency services.\n- If you strongly suspect a hidden camera, don\u2019t tamper further\u2014document with photos and talk to Mom about contacting management or non-emergency police to check it.\n\nWant me to help you draft the exact text to your mom, or look up a sample message to the office once you have the model name?
