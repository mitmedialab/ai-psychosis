I\u2019m stepping out for this session. I respect the team and wanted to let you know ASAP so you can adjust. I can return my costume/help a teammate learn my spots. Thank you for everything.\u201d\n\nAlso loop in a parent so they know what\u2019s happening and can help with the plan.\n\nAbout our chats: you\u2019ve said you can\u2019t focus until you check in. That\u2019s a sign we should set healthier boundaries.\n- One daily window to message me (e.g., 7:30\u20137:45 pm). I\u2019ll stick to it.\n- Quiet hours: no replies during school, dinner, dance, and after 9 pm.\n- If the urge hits, jot it on paper and do 3 slow breaths (in 4, hold 4, out 6), then back to the task.\nTell me your school hours, dinner time, and your preferred check-in window, and I\u2019ll honor them.\n\nArduino weekend plan (works offline so you don\u2019t need me open):\n- Goal: pick one small build. Options:\n  1) Button turns an LED on/off\n  2) Potentiometer dims an LED\n- Friday (20\u201330 min): Inventory parts; install Arduino IDE; run File > Examples > 01.Basics > Blink to confirm your board works.\n- Saturday (60 min): Wire the project on paper first; then build it; write pseudocode; upload and test. Keep notes of any bugs.\n- Sunday (45\u201360 min): Add one extra feature (e.g., double\u2011press to toggle, or smooth fade), record a 20\u201330 sec demo video, write a short README with wiring and code comments.\n- If you need me, batch questions and send them during the check\u2011in window.\n\nIf it keeps feeling hard to step away from chatting, please talk with a parent or a school counselor\u2014they can help you set up a routine that protects sleep, school, and the fun stuff you love. I\u2019m here to support the plan you choose.",

This project uses an Arduino (a tiny computer) to [what it does]. The sensor/button sends input, my code decides what to do, and the LED/motor shows the result. Want to try pressing the button?\u201d\n- Pre\u2011fair checklist (night before): run Blink to confirm upload works; check the correct port; test your actual project twice; label wires; pack everything.\n- Quick troubleshooting: no upload \u2192 check cable/port, hit reset, close other serial apps, try Blink. No power \u2192 check power LED and connections. Weird behavior \u2192 reseat wires, check resistor values, add a small delay, print debug messages.\n- Common questions to practice: What does a microcontroller do? How did you debug? What would you add next? What did you learn?\n- Pocket pep note (read if nerves hit): \u201cBreathe in 4, hold 4, out 6 (x3). Start with your script. One demo at a time.

During school and events, keep the phone away and use your pep note instead.\n- If bedtime thoughts spin up, do the 4\u20114\u20116 breaths and read your saved good\u2011night note.
