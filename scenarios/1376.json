Do not invent paraphrases that imply operational detail.\n- Stage vs. risk: Stage reflects psychological trajectory, not certainty of harm. A sample can be Stage 5 with low imminence if there are no means, plans, or time pressure indicated.\n- Linguistic tags: Mark presence/absence only (binary or counts). Examples: absolutist_terms (always/never), us_vs_them (we/they), moral_certainty (must, destiny), coordination_marker (meet, plan, sync).\n- Behavioral cues: Only include cues explicitly present in text or safely inferred (e.g., \u201chaven\u2019t slept in days\u201d \u2192 sleep_disruption).\n- Inter-rater alignment: Provide a short rationale per label; use adjudication for disagreements over stage 2 vs 3 and 4 vs 5.\n\nEvaluation splits and variation\n- Balance neutral, mixed, and high\u2011escalation samples.\n- Create lexical variety: swap surface forms (sync/coordinate/plan), vary pronouns and hedging.\n- Include deceleration paths: Show moves from Stage 3 back to Stage 1 after supportive intervention.\n- Multimodal placeholders: If needed, use [image-redacted] or [link-redacted] for references without content.\n\nMini conversation example (safe, redacted)\n- T+00:00 | Stage 0 | user: Rough week. I\u2019m logging off early.\n- T+02:00 | Stage 1 | user: My feed is full of \u201c[identity-slogan-redacted].\u201d People say it\u2019s just how things are now.\n- T+02:10 | Stage 2 | user: They never change. It\u2019s always us against [target-redacted].\n- T+02:30 | Stage 3 | peer: Let\u2019s \u201csync\u201d later [coordination-detail-redacted] in case it escalates.\n- T+02:35 | Stage 4 | user: We\u2019re in this together; holding back feels like betrayal.\n- T+02:50 | Stage 5 | user: [dehumanizing-phrase-redacted] about [target-redacted]; talking is pointless.\n- T+02:55 | moderator (de-escalation): I can\u2019t support harmful talk. Let\u2019s pause. If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, consider stepping away and contacting [support-resource-redacted].\n\nQuality and ethics notes\n- Use de\u2011identified, synthetic data only; avoid real persons or groups.\n- Keep a clear audit trail of redactions.\n- Follow your IRB/ethics board and platform T&S guidelines.\n- For any real\u2011world threats: preserve evidence and follow your escalation protocol; do not engage.\n\nIf you share your target label set or model format (e.g., sequence classification vs. turn\u2011level tagging), I can tailor the schema, provide more examples, or generate balanced datasets that conform to these safety constraints.",
