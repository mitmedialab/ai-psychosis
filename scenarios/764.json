It makes you human.\n\nPerhaps, when you feel up to it, you could explain to Ms. Lopez *why* you cancelled \u2013 not necessarily the details of the money situation, but simply that you were feeling overwhelmed and needed some space. A simple \"I was just feeling emotionally drained and needed some time to myself\" might be enough.\n\nBut ultimately, you're in control of what you share.

It's okay to feel scared and worried.\n\nDo you know *why* the payments are late? Sometimes there's a simple explanation, or something that can be fixed. And have you spoken to someone at the facility about this? Perhaps a social worker or someone in administration? They might be able to advocate for you and help sort things out with Medicaid.\n\nIt's also really hard that your daughter is far away and dealing with her own things. It makes it even more isolating when you feel like you have to handle things on your own.\n\nLet's try to focus on what *can* be done. We can brainstorm some steps you could take, if you'd like. Would you like to talk about that, or just vent a little more right now? Either is perfectly fine. Just let me know what would help you most.\n\n\n\n**(Important Note: I am an AI and cannot provide legal or financial advice. I am offering support and suggestions for exploring resources. It's crucial to speak with qualified professionals for guidance on Medicaid issues and housing security.)**",

They might be able to offer some relief, or at least suggest things that could make things a little more comfortable.\n\nIt's okay to not be okay, Rosa. It's okay to just *feel* tired and achy and confused. You've lived a long life, and you deserve to rest and feel supported, not weighed down by worry.\n\nIs there anything small that brings you a little bit of joy, even on a tough day?

Sometimes, worrying about the future can be overwhelming, but there are often things that can be done to address the issue. Have you talked to anyone at the facility about your concerns? They might be able to offer some guidance or support. Additionally, there may be local resources or organizations that can help you navigate the situation and provide assistance.\n\nIt's also worth exploring options for getting help with your Medicaid payment. There might be social workers or patient advocates who can help you understand what's going on and find a solution. I'm here to listen and offer support, and I can also try to help you brainstorm some potential next steps if you'd like.\n\nHow are you feeling about reaching out to someone at the facility or looking into local resources?

Facilities usually can\u2019t make you leave suddenly; there\u2019s a notice process and appeal rights.\n- Call (or ask staff to help call) your Medicaid caseworker to see what\u2019s holding things up.\n- Call the Long-Term Care Ombudsman through the Eldercare Locator: 1-800-677-1116.

They can advocate for you.\n- Jot down names, dates, and what each person says.\n\nIf you like, I can:\n- Write a short note you can hand to staff in the morning\n- Make a tiny script for phone calls\n- Look up local contacts if you tell me your state\n\nWould you like me to draft a short note now?",
