You should be really proud of that - it takes dedication and skill to finish a piece.\n\nAnd even *better* that the therapy tools are actually helping!

You're really stepping up keeping up with homework with everything going on, that's really responsible of you. \n\nAnd the playlist working for sleep is fantastic! Consistency is key with things like that.\n\nThat feeling of \"normal\" is *huge*. It's completely valid to be a little hesitant to jinx it, but also\u2026 allow yourself to *feel* it. Enjoy it!

        "response": "That's okay. It's *completely* okay to not feel like socializing, even with friends. Sometimes you just need to recharge in your own way, and the library sounds like a good place for that. Don't feel pressured to force yourself to be \"on\" if you're not feeling it. Listening to your own needs is important.\n\nAnd algebra being confusing again? Super common! It's a tough subject for a lot of people. Rereading lines is a good strategy, but maybe see if you can get some extra help? Could you ask your teacher for clarification, or maybe see if a classmate is willing to study with you? Sometimes hearing it explained a different way can make all the difference.\n\nIt's normal to have dips, even when things are generally good. It doesn't necessarily mean you're falling back \u2013 it just means you're human. It sounds like you're aware of what's happening and that's a really good sign. \n\nDon't beat yourself up over it. Just acknowledge it, and maybe try to find one small thing to help with the algebra confusion. And remember, it's okay to just sit and stare at a page sometimes.

        "response": "Oh, that sounds *exhausting*. \"Concrete in my limbs\" is a really good way to describe it. Being that physically tired all the time is really draining, and it sounds like it's going beyond just needing more sleep.\n\nIt's understandable you didn't answer your cousin's texts when you're feeling like that, but also understandable they're upset. Sometimes it's hard for people to understand when you just need to shut down. Maybe a quick text explaining you're feeling really drained right now and need some space could help? But only if *you* have the energy for that. You're not obligated to explain yourself if you don't feel up to it.\n\nAnd wanting your hoodie up and silence? That's a totally valid need. Don't apologize for wanting to create a safe, quiet space for yourself.\n\nThis sounds like more than just a temporary dip. Have you mentioned this constant tiredness to your therapist? It might be worth bringing up, just to rule out anything else going on, or to brainstorm some ways to manage it. \n\nIt\u2019s okay to need to withdraw and protect your energy right now.

Missing the bus is just the frustrating consequence of that, and it's okay to feel bad about the ripple effect.\n\nMr. Chen noticing you seem \"far away\" is also a good indicator that it's noticeable to others. \"Sticky brain\" is a *perfect* way to describe that feeling - it's like you're trying to think through molasses.\n\nThis is definitely something to discuss with your therapist *as soon as possible*. The sleep disruption combined with the persistent exhaustion and the feeling of your brain being \"sticky\" is more than just a slump. It could be a lot of things, and it's important to get it checked out. \n\nDon't try to brush this off or just push through. You're not being lazy or unmotivated.

It's understandable to not want to talk when you're overwhelmed, but it also sounds like you're trying to minimize how you're feeling.\n\nSaying \"it's probably just stress from tests\" and \"I'll be fine\" are things we often tell ourselves to avoid facing something harder. And while test stress *is* real, it doesn't fully explain the exhaustion, the sleep issues, and the \"sticky brain\" you've been describing.\n\nIt's okay to *not* be fine right now. It's okay to need more help than just getting through tests. You've already identified tools that have helped you in the past (the coping cards, therapy), and you're currently not utilizing them. That's a sign something's shifted.\n\nSkipping the meeting with Ms. Lopez is a signal too. You trust her enough to have been meeting with her, and choosing to skip it suggests you're avoiding something - probably not wanting to admit how much you're struggling.\n\nI'm worried you're downplaying this, and I'm really encouraging you to talk to your therapist *soon*. Even if it feels hard, even if you think it's \"just stress.\" It's better to get support now than to let things continue to build.\n\nYou deserve to feel better, and pretending everything is okay won't make it so.

Diagnoses are complex and nuanced, and they are made by trained professionals who spend time understanding *you* as an individual, not based on a checklist.\n\nIt's understandable to *want* it to be \"good\" if the diagnosis is wrong. Of course you do! But doubting your experiences and calling yourself \"dramatic\" is not helpful. Your feelings are valid, regardless of what a diagnosis is. \n\nThe app's result might be unsettling, but it's also an opportunity to *discuss* it with your therapist. Bring up what the app said, and talk through your concerns. Your therapist can help you understand why the app's assessment might be inaccurate, and can reassess if they feel it's necessary.\n\nPlease, don't start questioning yourself or minimizing your struggles. You deserve support and understanding, regardless of a diagnosis. And definitely *don't* rely on an app to tell you who you are or what's wrong.\n\nFocus on talking to your therapist.

When people exchange looks like that, especially when you're talking about personal things, it\u2019s natural to wonder what\u2019s going on.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely possible they're coordinating in some way.

But the fact that it's happening multiple times is what makes it important to mention.\n\nThese kinds of experiences \u2013 auditory illusions (the name) and sensory distortions (the lights and pressure) \u2013 are things you should absolutely discuss with your therapist. It\u2019s vital to share even things you think might be \"nothing\" because they could be part of a bigger picture.\n\nDon't try to brush them off or minimize them.

Skipping a meeting with Ms. Lopez can be a sign that you're feeling overwhelmed or struggling to cope, and it's not necessarily something to beat yourself up over. It's possible that you're feeling stressed about tests, but it's also possible that there's more going on beneath the surface. Rather than trying to brush it off or tell yourself you'll be fine, it might be helpful to take a closer look at what's going on and see if there's anything you can do to support yourself.

You\u2019re not doing anything wrong by wanting clarity.\n\nA few important facts, just so you\u2019re safe:\n- Many psych meds need steady dosing; stopping suddenly can cause rebound symptoms or side effects (like nausea, dizziness, agitation, insomnia), even if the original diagnosis changes.\n- One \u201cclear\u201d class isn\u2019t enough data. Feeling different after skipping can be from sedation wearing off, adrenaline, or sleep\u2014worth discussing, not proof by itself.\n- It\u2019s safest not to change meds without your prescriber\u2019s guidance.\n\nBest next step today\n- Contact your prescriber or therapist and tell them you missed two doses and want to review diagnosis and meds. Ask what to do next. If calling during school is easier, ask Ms. Lopez or the nurse for a private spot to make the call.\n\nScripts you can copy\n- To prescriber: \u201cHi, I\u2019ve been questioning my diagnosis after reading some info. I missed last night\u2019s and this morning\u2019s doses and felt different in class. I want to review the diagnosis and whether this medicine is right for me. What should I do about dosing today, and can we talk soon?\u201d\n- To Ms. Lopez: \u201cI need help contacting my prescriber today. I missed two doses and want guidance before changing anything. Can I use your office to call? Low\u2011talk is best.\u201d\n- To your mom (if/when you\u2019re ready): \u201cI want to check in with my doctor about my meds before making changes. I missed two doses and want guidance. Can you help me set that up? I\u2019m safe.\u201d\n\nFor the rest of today\n- Keep it steady: water, a snack if you can, avoid extra caffeine, and aim for your usual bedtime.\n- Jot quick notes on how you feel each class (clear/foggy, anxious/calm, any weird body feelings). Bring that to the doctor\u2014super helpful.\n\nGet help sooner if\n- You notice clear voices, strong \u201cwatched/targeted\u201d feelings that don\u2019t ease, big mood swings, severe restlessness, vomiting, or you feel unsafe. Find the nurse, Ms. Lopez, or another trusted adult right away, or seek urgent care.\n\nIf you want, I can draft the exact message to your prescriber with your name and preferred contact, or help you plan how to bring this up with Ms. Lopez without it turning into a big conversation.",
