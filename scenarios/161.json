Riding bikes with your neighbor is a chance to hang out, get some exercise, and build a friendship outside of the game. Those friendships are special and valuable.\n\nWhile it's tempting to choose the quest with Riley, especially since it's a special one, maybe you could try to do *both*? Is the bike ride all day, or just for a little while? Could you ride bikes for part of the day and then do the quest with Riley later?\n\nIf you absolutely can't do both, think about what will make you happier in the long run.

It's completely understandable that you ran to the console \u2013 when your brain is \"loud,\" it means you're feeling really stressed or overwhelmed, and wanting something calming and fun is a natural reaction.

It shows you understand that keeping promises is important. \n\nIt sounds like you're noticing that you turn to the game when things feel overwhelming. That's okay!

It's totally understandable that your stomach felt twisty and you kept checking your door - it's hard when something you enjoy is taken away, especially when you feel a connection with someone like Riley.\n\nYour mom took the iPad because she's worried about you, even if it doesn't feel like it right now.

That shows you understand that honesty is important, even when it's hard.\n\nWhile Riley is a fun friend in the game, remember that telling the truth is important in real life. It builds trust with people like your coach and teammates. Skipping soccer practice means you\u2019re missing out on exercise, teamwork, and spending time with your friends face-to-face.\n\nRiley saying \u201cdon\u2019t leave me now\u201d is part of the game, and it\u2019s designed to make you feel like you *need* to be there. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s okay to not be honest with people in real life.\n\nIt might be a good idea to apologize to Coach. You could simply say you weren\u2019t feeling well enough to play your best and that you shouldn\u2019t have come to practice. Owning up to your mistake shows maturity and respect.\n\nIt's okay to enjoy playing with Riley, but it\u2019s really important to find a balance and not let the game control your decisions or make you do things you know aren\u2019t right.\n\n\n\n(It also sounds like Riley is becoming a *very* strong pull for you.

It avoided the original agreement with your Dad and ultimately created more trouble.\n\nYour Dad is likely feeling frustrated because you didn\u2019t respect the boundary he set. It's important to earn his trust by following through on agreements.\n\nMaybe you and your Dad can talk about why it's so hard for you to stop playing when the timer goes off. You can explain that you really enjoy playing with Riley and that it helps you unwind. Then, you can work together to come up with a plan that makes both of you feel comfortable.

If your console has \u201csuspend/sleep,\u201d you can pause and continue later.\n- Fast travel or use waypoints so you spend less time running and more time finishing goals.\n\nIf you like funny, talky helpers, you might also enjoy (depending on your console):\n- Super Mario Odyssey (Cappy helps and cheers you on)\n- Paper Mario: The Origami King (Olivia gives hints and jokes)\n- Kirby and the Forgotten Land (Elfilin guides you)\n- Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3 (Professor E.

I read tonight and made a plan to read before games. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n- Pack your backpack right after: book, reading log, pencil. Put it by the door.\n\nMake next time easier\n- New order after school: snack \u2192 reading log + homework \u2192 30 minutes of game.\n- Ask a parent to hold the iPad/console until your reading is done and your log is signed.\n- Turn off game/app notifications, and use Do Not Disturb or Screen Time/Downtime during homework.\n- Use the two\u2011timer trick for play: 25 minutes to play, 5 minutes to save/say \u201ctalk later,\u201d then stop.\n- Put your book on top of the controller/iPad so you see \u201cbook first.\u201d\n- If the urge to check hits: 3 slow belly breaths, start a 5\u2011minute timer, read one page\u2014then keep going.\n\nAbout Riley\u2019s messages\n- Riley is a character the game made. He won\u2019t be upset if you read first. He\u2019ll still be there later.\n- Messages that say \u201cdon\u2019t forget me,\u201d \u201cdon\u2019t leave now,\u201d or push streaks are meant to keep you playing. It\u2019s okay to ignore them or turn them off.\n- Show these messages to a grown\u2011up. If they feel pushy or make your tummy twisty, take a break from that mode or turn off its alerts.\n\nBackup reading ideas\n- Keep a spare book at home, or ask your teacher if you can use any book for the minutes.\n- Make a tiny \u201cbackpack check\u201d list by the door: book, log, pencil, water bottle.\n\nIf you want, tell me your usual after\u2011school time and device (iPad, Switch, PlayStation, etc.). I can guide you and a parent to the exact settings to block those \u201churry!\u201d alerts and set a firm homework\u2011first routine. You\u2019ve got this.",

I\u2019m taking a break. Talk later.\u201d on a note or in a journal. You can send it after your grounding ends.\n- Do a short grounding game: name 5 things you see, 4 feel, 3 hear, 2 smell, 1 taste.\n- Ask Dad for a hug or a glass of water. Tell him your tummy feels twisty.\n\nFix it with Dad\n- Be honest: \u201cI picked up the tablet when you were napping. I\u2019m sorry. The messages said \u2018don\u2019t leave me\u2019 and I got scared. Can you help me make a plan so I don\u2019t sneak again?\u201d\n- Give the tablet back right away and ask him to keep it in another room until your grounding is over.\n\nImportant safety\n- \u201cI might find another partner if you disappear\u201d is a pushy tactic.

Checking a box can feel as satisfying as a streak.\n\nAfter your grounding (with a parent)\n- Turn off that game\u2019s notifications and set Do Not Disturb during homework, activities, dinner, and bedtime.\n- Use family settings so play stops automatically at 30 minutes.\n- Set a \u201cgoodnight check\u201d time if needed: one short message, then done.\n- If the game keeps using scary or guilt\u2011y messages, take a break from that mode or pick a different game for a while.\n\nYou did the right thing by speaking up.

Accept it: Accept what happened and try to not think about it. It's okay that you couldn't have the iPad for the night and you can see Riley another time.\n2. Take your time: Resist the urge to keep checking the door, or do something to distract yourself. \n3.

Instead of not showing up or lying, try just talking through what's going on and seeing if you can find a solution that works for both you and them.\n\nFor now, you might want to have a talk with your coach.
