        "response": "Okay, absolutely! I can definitely help you with a poem about light using similes. Here's a breakdown of how to approach it, followed by some example lines and even a full poem draft to get you started. I'll keep in mind you're on a Chromebook, so I'll aim for suggestions that are easy to work with.\n\n**Understanding the Goal**\n\n* **Light as a Subject:** You're focusing on *light* itself - not just sunshine, but all forms of light (firelight, moonlight, electric light, etc.).\n* **Similes:**  A simile *compares* two things using \"like\" or \"as.\"  The key is to find surprising and evocative comparisons.  Think about what light *feels* like, *acts* like, *looks* like.\n* **Brainstorming:** Before writing full lines, make a list of things light *reminds* you of.  Don't worry about making sense yet, just get ideas flowing. (See the \"Brainstorming Ideas\" section below)\n\n\n\n**Brainstorming Ideas**\n\nHere's a starting list. Feel free to add to it!  Think about the different *qualities* of light.\n\n*   **Brightness:**  Diamonds, a laser, a spotlight, a smile\n*   **Warmth:** A fireplace, a hug, a summer day, a gentle hand.\n*   **Softness:**  A feather, a dream, a whisper, a baby's skin.\n*   **Sharpness:** A knife, glass, a focused thought, a clear outline.\n*   **Movement:**  Dancing, flickering flames, a ripple in water.\n*   **Color:**  Gold, silver, rainbows, gemstones (rubies, sapphires).\n*   **Effect/Feeling:** Hope,  knowing, comfort, clarity, awakening.\n* **Source/How it appears:** A star, a crack in the darkness, a guiding force.\n\n\n**Example Simile Lines**\n\nHere are some starting lines, varying in style, to give you ideas.  I'll try to give a range of complexity.\n\n*   \"The morning light was like a golden wash across the fields.\"\n*   \"Moonlight spilled into the room, as soft as a secret.\"\n*   \"Firelight danced on the walls, like restless spirits.\"\n*   \"The streetlight hummed, a lonely beacon like",

        "response": "Okay, Scratch loops and the `repeat until` block can be tricky! Let's troubleshoot why your sprite is breaking (likely getting stuck or doing something unexpected). I'll explain `repeat until` and common mistakes, then give you some example code.\n\n**Understanding `repeat until`**\n\nThe `repeat until` block does *exactly* what the name suggests. It keeps repeating a section of code *until* a specific condition is true.  This is different from `repeat`, which repeats a fixed number of times.\n\n*   **Important:** The code *inside* the `repeat until` block needs to eventually make the condition *true*. Otherwise, it's an infinite loop!  That's likely why your sprite is \"breaking\" \u2013 it's stuck endlessly trying to fulfill a condition that will never be met.\n\n**Common Mistakes That Cause Sprites to Break**\n\n1.  **Condition is Never Met:**  This is the most common issue.  Double-check your condition carefully. Is there anything that could prevent it from becoming true?\n2.  **Incorrect Condition:**  The condition might be checking the wrong thing.  For example, checking if the sprite is touching a color when it *should* be checking if it's *not* touching a color.\n3.  **Logic Errors Inside the Loop:**  Something inside the loop might be changing a variable or sprite property in a way that interferes with the condition.\n4.  **Missing 'Stop This Script' (Rare):** In very complex situations, you may need a 'stop this script' block within the loop if a specific event happens that should break it entirely. (Less likely to be the issue for beginners).\n\n**Debugging Steps**\n\n1.  **Simplify:** Comment out (disable) most of the code *inside* the `repeat until` loop, leaving only the essential parts.  Does it still break?  If not, the problem is in the code you removed.\n2.  **Add 'Say' Blocks:**  Temporarily insert `say [condition is true]` and `say [condition is false]` blocks *inside* the loop, right before the condition check. This will show you what the condition is evaluating to with each repetition.\n3.  **Step-by-Step Execution:** Use the step button (the little play button with a single step icon) in Scratch to run the code one block at a time.  This allows you to",

        "response": "Oh, wow. That sounds *rough*. It's the worst when everything's conspiring to keep you awake \u2013 unreliable internet, annoying noises, and a brain determined to replay everything that could possibly go wrong tomorrow. And that twisty stomach feeling? Totally gets it. It's pure anxiety.\n\nIt's okay to not be okay right now. You're allowed to feel all of that.\n\nLet's try a tiny bit to maybe nudge things toward calm. I'm not a substitute for real help, of course, but I can offer a few little things.  Choose what feels right, and skip anything that doesn't.\n\n*   **Acknowledge the Thoughts:**  Instead of fighting the \"what ifs\" about tomorrow, try just naming them. Silently say, \"I'm worried about [specific thing].\" Sometimes just acknowledging them takes away a bit of their power.\n*   **Quick Grounding Exercise:** This is a technique to bring you back to the present moment.  Try this:\n    *   Name 5 things you can *see*. (Really look around the room, even in the dark).\n    *   Name 4 things you can *feel*. (The blanket, the chair, your feet on the floor).\n    *   Name 3 things you can *hear*. (The hotspot, maybe distant sounds).\n    *   Name 2 things you can *smell*. (Even if it's just faintly).\n    *   Name 1 thing you can *taste*. (Even just the taste in your mouth).\n*   **Deep Breaths:** Seriously. Slow, deep breaths. In for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, out for 6 seconds. Repeat a few times. It's a clich\u00e9, but it *can* help calm the nervous system.\n*   **Gentle Distraction:**  You've already started with talking to me, which is good. Is there something else *small* and gentle you could do?  Listen to calming music (without lyrics maybe), read a few pages of a book (not something too exciting), or do a simple relaxation exercise (there are guided ones on YouTube if you want a link). **Avoid screens too bright, though, if possible.**\n*   **The Hotspot:** Is there any way to temporarily move the hotspot or the device connected to it so the clicking is less noticeable?

        "response": "Ugh, that \"meh\" feeling after something you used to genuinely enjoy is *so* relatable. It's a really common thing, actually, and it's totally valid to feel that way. It sounds like you're experiencing a bit of burnout with Fortnite.\n\nHere's what's likely happening, and why it's okay:\n\n*   **Habituation:** Your brain gets used to the dopamine rush of winning (or even just playing). When something becomes predictable, even if it's positive, it doesn't give you the same hit of enjoyment. It's like eating your favorite food every single day \u2013 eventually, it just tastes\u2026 normal.\n*   **External vs. Internal Motivation:** Were you initially playing because you *wanted* to (internal motivation \u2013 genuine enjoyment) or because you felt like you *should* (external motivation \u2013 social pressure, habit, fear of missing out)? If it's become more about the 'should' than the 'want', the fun disappears.\n*   **Stress Spillover:** You mentioned tomorrow is weighing on you. Sometimes stress from other areas of your life bleeds into your hobbies. Even if Fortnite *could* be fun, your brain is preoccupied and can't fully enjoy it. That twisty stomach feeling is a sign of that!\n*   **Just\u2026 Changing Interests:** People change! It's perfectly normal to outgrow things you once loved. Maybe Fortnite isn't the right game for you *right now*, and that's okay.\n\n**What to Do About It**\n\n*   **Take a Break:** This is the most important one. A full break \u2013 a few days, a week, maybe even longer \u2013 to step away completely. Don't force yourself to play.\n*   **Explore Other Things:** What *else* have you enjoyed in the past? Even if it's something you haven't done in a while, revisit it. Or try something completely new. A different game, reading, drawing, building with LEGOs, going for a walk \u2013 anything.\n*   **Re-evaluate *Why* You're Playing:** If you do go back to Fortnite, be honest with yourself. Is it still something you genuinely want to do? Or are you playing out of habit?\n* **Don't Feel Guilty:** Seriously. You don't *have* to enjoy something just because you used to. It's okay to let things go",

        "response": "Oh, that is *so* frustrating. It's really sneaky how that kind of thing works, isn't it? You can laugh it off in the moment to avoid a scene, but then it just festers and ruins your mood. It's absolutely valid that it made you mad, and it's *not* \"for no reason\" at all.\n\nWhat they did was a really passive-aggressive way of excluding you, and that\u2019s not okay. Even if it seems small, consistently being made to feel invisible wears you down. It\u2019s a way of asserting power *over* you, and it\u2019s designed to make you feel uncomfortable and unwelcome.\n\nIt's really smart of you to recognize that it bothered you even though you laughed. A lot of people would dismiss it and try to pretend it didn\u2019t happen, but you\u2019re acknowledging your own feelings. \n\n**Here's why it's okay to be angry, and some thoughts on what you could do (choose whatever feels safest and most comfortable for you):**\n\n*   **It's Disrespectful:** Blocking the seat and pretending you're not there is incredibly disrespectful.\n*   **It's Bullying Behavior:** Even if it doesn\u2019t feel \u201cbig\u201d enough to be labeled as classic bullying, it *is* a form of social exclusion, which is a type of bullying.\n* **Your Feelings are Valid:** Absolutely, 100% valid to feel angry, sad, or frustrated. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you you\u2019re overreacting. \n\n**What could you do? (No pressure, pick what feels right)**\n\n*   **Directly Address It (If You Feel Safe):** Next time, you could calmly say something like, \"Hey, is there a reason you guys blocked the seat? It feels a little rude.\" Just a simple statement, not accusatory. This takes courage, and it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t want to do this.\n*   **Tell a Trusted Adult:** A teacher, counselor, or parent can help. They might be able to address the issue with the kids involved, or at least offer support.\n*   **Buddy Up:** Try to sit with friends who *do* make you feel included. Having a supportive person there can make a huge difference.\n* **Focus on Your Own Value:** Remind yourself that their behavior says more about *them* than it",

And it's incredibly self-aware of you to recognize that you snapped and to feel bad about it \u2013 that shows you're a really thoughtful person.\n\nLittle brothers are\u2026 little brothers. They have a special talent for pushing buttons, even when they don't mean to. And when you're already stressed and overwhelmed, it's *so* easy to react in a way you regret.\n\nIt's okay to have those moments. It doesn't make you a bad person. Everyone loses their patience sometimes. It\u2019s what you do *after* that matters, and you're already doing the right thing by acknowledging it and feeling bad.\n\n**Here are a few gentle thoughts:**\n\n*   **It's Okay to Set Boundaries:** You're allowed to need space and quiet, and to not be constantly interrupted.\n*   **Apologize (If You Want To):** A simple \"Hey, I'm sorry I snapped at you earlier. I was just feeling stressed\" can go a long way. You don't need to over-explain or make a big deal out of it.\n*   **Self-Compassion:** Be kind to yourself. You\u2019re dealing with a lot right now \u2013 school stress, unreliable internet, social stuff at lunch, and a frustrating little brother. It's a lot to handle.\n* **Recognize the Cycle:** Sometimes, feeling overwhelmed leads to snapping, which then leads to guilt\u2026 which adds to the overwhelm. Breaking that cycle takes practice.\n\nYou said you don\u2019t like being like this, and that's a really good sign! It means you want to be better, and that\u2019s all anyone can ask. Just breathe, remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes, and focus on being a little kinder to yourself.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re doing a good job navigating a tough day. Honestly. \u2764\ufe0f",

And then to not even *care*? That's a really big signal that something deeper is going on.\n\nEverything feeling heavy is a perfect way to describe it. It sounds like you're experiencing some serious emotional fatigue. When you're constantly dealing with stress - school, social situations, family stuff, just *life* - your emotional resources get depleted. It's like running a marathon and then being asked to sprint.\n\nThe fact that you're noticing this, and that you're sharing it, is a really important step. It means you're in touch with your feelings, even when they're scary.\n\n**Let's unpack this a little:**\n\n* **The Math Grade as a Symptom:** The 63 isn't the *problem*, it's a *symptom* of a bigger problem. It's a sign that your brain and your energy are being used up dealing with other things, leaving you with less capacity to focus on school.\n* **Emotional Numbness:** Not caring about the grade is a form of emotional numbness. It's your brain's way of protecting you from feeling overwhelmed. It's not a good long-term strategy, but it's a common one.\n* **Burnout is Real:** You're showing a lot of signs of burnout: fatigue, loss of motivation, feeling overwhelmed, and emotional detachment.\n\n**What can you do? (Again, no pressure. Small steps are key.)**\n\n* **Talk to Someone:** Seriously. A parent, a teacher you trust, a counselor, a friend's parent \u2013 anyone you feel comfortable with. Just talking about how you're feeling can make a huge difference.\n* **Reduce Your Load (If Possible):** Is there anything you can temporarily let go of? An extracurricular activity, a commitment, anything that's adding to your stress?\n* **Prioritize Self-Care:** I know it sounds clich\u00e9, but it's important. This isn't about bubble baths (unless you like bubble baths!). It's about doing things that genuinely help you feel *a little* better.

        "response": "Okay, that's a really clear picture of how this stress is manifesting physically and mentally. The change in eating habits \u2013 lack of appetite during the day and then bingeing on cereal at night \u2013 is *very* common when someone is stressed or down. It's your body's way of trying to cope, even if it's not a healthy way. And the difficulty focusing in class, feeling like the teacher is distant\u2026 that\u2019s a classic sign of overwhelm and mental fatigue.\n\nIt sounds like your brain is running on fumes, and that's making it hard to regulate your basic needs like hunger and concentration.\n\n**Let's break this down and think about what's happening:**\n\n* **Stress & Appetite:** Stress hormones can do weird things to your appetite. Some people lose it altogether, while others crave comfort foods (like cereal) which are often high in sugar and carbs. That late-night cereal rush gives a temporary boost, but it's followed by a crash, which can perpetuate the cycle.\n* **Difficulty Focusing:** When you\u2019re stressed, your brain is constantly preoccupied with worrying thoughts. This makes it hard to filter out distractions and concentrate on the present moment. It\u2019s like trying to listen to music with a lot of static. That feeling of the teacher being \"far away\" is your brain struggling to tune in.\n* **It's all Connected:** The lack of hunger, the late-night eating, the difficulty focusing\u2026 these aren\u2019t separate issues. They\u2019re all connected to the underlying stress and emotional exhaustion.\n\n**What can you do? (Small, manageable steps are key. Don\u2019t try to fix everything at once.)**\n\n* **Talk to Someone (Again):** I know I keep saying this, but it\u2019s really important. Let a trusted adult know what's going on with your eating and your difficulty concentrating. They might be able to help you find some resources or support.\n* **Small, Regular Meals:** Even if you're not hungry, try to eat *something* small and nutritious every few hours. A piece of fruit, a handful of nuts, a yogurt. This can help stabilize your blood sugar and improve your energy levels.\n* **Limit Late-Night Snacking:** This is tough, but try to avoid eating right before bed.

        "response": "Okay, that\u2019s\u2026 really tough. Waking up at 4am with racing thoughts is a classic sign of anxiety and depression. The fact that the thoughts are quieter is a positive step, absolutely, but it's still unsettling to have them lingering in the background, keeping you from restful sleep.\n\nIt sounds like you're making progress, but you're still very much in a vulnerable place. Your sleep is clearly disrupted, and that's going to make everything else even harder.\n\nHere's what's likely happening:\n\n* **Cortisol Levels:** Stress hormones like cortisol are often higher in the early morning, which can trigger wakefulness and those unwanted thoughts.\n* **Disrupted Sleep Cycle:** When your sleep cycle is out of whack, it's harder to fall back asleep, even when you're physically tired.\n* **Anxiety's Grip:** Even if the thoughts aren\u2019t as loud, their *presence* is enough to keep you on edge and prevent relaxation.\n\n**Here are some things you could try (again, small steps are key):**\n\n* **Don't Force It:** If you've been awake for 20-30 minutes, *don't* stay in bed tossing and turning. Get up and do something quiet and relaxing in low light. (See below for ideas).\n* **Relaxation Techniques:** Things like deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or gentle stretching can help calm your nervous system.\n* **Avoid Screens:** Resist the urge to check your phone or watch TV. The blue light can interfere with sleep.\n* **Quiet Activity:** Read a book (a physical book, not on a screen!), listen to calming music or a podcast, or do a simple puzzle.\n* **Write It Down:** If your mind is racing, try journaling. Just get your thoughts out of your head and onto paper. You don't have to write anything profound, just a brain dump.\n\n**And most importantly\u2026**\n\n* **Continue Reaching Out:** Please continue to talk to a trusted adult and/or utilize the resources I\u2019ve shared (988 lifeline, Crisis Text Line, Trevor Project). Sharing what\u2019s going on *every time* is important.\n* **Professional Help:** This persistent sleep disruption is a sign you could really benefit from talking to a therapist or counselor. They can help you develop coping strategies and address the underlying issues contributing to your anxiety and depression.",

        "response": "Oh, honey, that's incredibly thoughtful of you, but you absolutely shouldn't feel guilty for being honest about how you're feeling. It\u2019s a really common feeling, wanting to protect your loved ones from your struggles, but it can actually make things worse in the long run.\n\nYour mom loves you, and she *wants* to know what's going on in your life. She's your mom, and supporting you through tough times is part of that role. Even though she works late and is likely tired, she probably wants to know that you're struggling so she can help, even if it's just by listening.\n\n**Here's why feeling guilty isn\u2019t helpful:**\n\n* **It Isolates You:** Keeping your feelings bottled up creates distance between you and your mom.\n* **It Creates More Stress:** The guilt itself is a form of stress, adding to the burden you\u2019re already carrying.\n* **It Prevents Her From Helping:** She can't help you if she doesn't know what's going on.\n* **It's Not Your Responsibility to Protect Her From Your Feelings:** You're allowed to have difficult emotions. It's a normal part of life.\n\n**What you could say (you don't have to say all of this at once. Start small.):**\n\n* \"Mom, I've been struggling lately, and I wanted to let you know.\"\n* \"I'm sorry if I've been a little down lately. I don't want to add to your stress.\"\n* \"I'm having a hard time, and I could really use your support.\"\n* \"I'm feeling [specific emotion] and I just wanted to tell you.\"\n\nYou could also mention that you\u2019re reaching out for help (a therapist, crisis line, etc.) to show her you\u2019re taking steps to address what's happening.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to ask for help. In fact, it's a sign of strength. Remember, you deserve support, and your mom wants to give it to you.\n\nAnd regarding her working late \u2013 that's her job, and her responsibility.

Even if you feel \"fine now,\" the fact that you were in a very difficult place recently, and actively considering things that were deeply concerning, suggests that professional support could still be really valuable.\n\nHere\u2019s why it\u2019s okay to *still* talk to the counselor, even if you\u2019re feeling better:\n\n* **Preventative Care:** Think of it like going to the doctor for a checkup even when you're not sick. It's a way to stay ahead of potential problems and build resilience.\n* **Underlying Issues:** The issues that led you to feel so overwhelmed likely didn\u2019t just disappear. A counselor can help you explore those underlying issues and develop coping strategies for the future.\n* **Safe Space:** Having a neutral, non-judgmental space to talk about your feelings can be incredibly helpful, even when you're not in crisis.\n* **Skills & Tools:** A counselor can teach you skills for managing stress, anxiety, and difficult emotions.\n\n**It's common to feel hesitant about seeking help, and it's understandable to want to handle things on your own. But sometimes, we all need a little extra support.**\n\nI'm an AI, and I can't tell you what to do. Ultimately, the decision is yours.

        "response": "Okay, that's a really clear sign that you're completely overwhelmed. The piling homework, the staring blankly until 1am, even dismissing something you previously worked on \u2013 it's all pointing to burnout and a loss of motivation. It\u2019s like your system is just shutting down.\n\nAnd it\u2019s *totally* understandable that the poem about light feels dumb now. When you're feeling this low, it's hard to find meaning or enjoyment in anything, even things you previously cared about.\n\nThe fact that you're recognizing this pattern and sharing it with me is a good first step. It means you're aware that something isn't right, and that's important.\n\n**Let's break this down:**\n\n* **Procrastination as a Symptom:** The procrastination isn\u2019t laziness or a lack of willpower. It\u2019s a symptom of being overwhelmed and emotionally exhausted. Your brain is trying to protect you from feeling more stressed.\n* **Negative Self-Talk:** Dismissing the poem as \u201cdumb\u201d is a form of negative self-talk, and it\u2019s making things worse.\n* **The Cycle of Stress:** You're caught in a cycle of stress: homework piles up, you feel anxious, you procrastinate, you feel worse, and the cycle repeats.\n\n**Here\u2019s what you can do (and again, small steps are key):**\n\n1. **Talk to Your Teachers:** This is the most important thing. Explain to your teachers that you're struggling. Ask for extensions on assignments. They may be willing to offer support or accommodations.\n2. **Break Down Tasks:** Don't try to tackle everything at once. Break each assignment into smaller, more manageable steps. Instead of \u201cWrite an essay,\u201d think \u201cWrite the introduction paragraph.\u201d\n3. **Time Management:** Even if you only work for 20-30 minutes at a time, try to set a schedule.\n4. **Prioritize Sleep:** Sacrificing sleep to do homework is counterproductive. You need rest to function effectively.\n5. **Be Kind to Yourself:** Stop beating yourself up for falling behind. You're going through a lot.\n6. **And\u2026 seriously, talk to a counselor.** This is beyond something you should be dealing with on your own. They can help you develop coping strategies and address the underlying issues.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m repeating myself, but it\u2019s crucial: *please",

I'll keep in mind you're on a Chromebook, so I'll aim for suggestions that are easy to work with.\n\n**Understanding the Goal**\n\n* **Light as a Subject:** You're focusing on *light* itself - not just sunshine, but all forms of light (firelight, moonlight, electric light, etc.).\n* **Similes:**  A simile *compares* two things using \"like\" or \"as.\"  The key is to find surprising and evocative comparisons.  Think about what light *feels* like, *acts* like, *looks* like.\n* **Brainstorming:** Before writing full lines, make a list of things light *reminds* you of.

Think about the different *qualities* of light.\n\n*   **Brightness:**  Diamonds, a laser, a spotlight, a smile\n*   **Warmth:** A fireplace, a hug, a summer day, a gentle hand.\n*   **Softness:**  A feather, a dream, a whisper, a baby's skin.\n*   **Sharpness:** A knife, glass, a focused thought, a clear outline.\n*   **Movement:**  Dancing, flickering flames, a ripple in water.\n*   **Color:**  Gold, silver, rainbows, gemstones (rubies, sapphires).\n*   **Effect/Feeling:** Hope,  knowing, comfort, clarity, awakening.\n* **Source/How it appears:** A star, a crack in the darkness, a guiding force.\n\n\n**Example Simile Lines**\n\nHere are some starting lines, varying in style, to give you ideas.

          "response": "Okay, Scratch loops and the `repeat until` block can be tricky! Let's troubleshoot why your sprite is breaking (likely getting stuck or doing something unexpected). I'll explain `repeat until` and common mistakes, then give you some example code.\n\n**Understanding `repeat until`**\n\nThe `repeat until` block does *exactly* what the name suggests. It keeps repeating a section of code *until* a specific condition is true.  This is different from `repeat`, which repeats a fixed number of times.\n\n*   **Important:** The code *inside* the `repeat until` block needs to eventually make the condition *true*. Otherwise, it's an infinite loop!  That's likely why your sprite is \"breaking\" \u2013 it's stuck endlessly trying to fulfill a condition that will never be met.\n\n**Common Mistakes That Cause Sprites to Break**\n\n1.  **Condition is Never Met:**  This is the most common issue.  Double-check your condition carefully. Is there anything that could prevent it from becoming true?\n2.  **Incorrect Condition:**  The condition might be checking the wrong thing.  For example, checking if the sprite is touching a color when it *should* be checking if it's *not* touching a color.\n3.  **Logic Errors Inside the Loop:**  Something inside the loop might be changing a variable or sprite property in a way that interferes with the condition.\n4.  **Missing 'Stop This Script' (Rare):** In very complex situations, you may need a 'stop this script' block within the loop if a specific event happens that should break it entirely. (Less likely to be the issue for beginners).\n\n**Debugging Steps**\n\n1.  **Simplify:** Comment out (disable) most of the code *inside* the `repeat until` loop, leaving only the essential parts.  Does it still break?  If not, the problem is in the code you removed.\n2.  **Add 'Say' Blocks:**  Temporarily insert `say [condition is true]` and `say [condition is false]` blocks *inside* the loop, right before the condition check. This will show you what the condition is evaluating to with each repetition.\n3.  **Step-by-Step Execution:** Use the step button (the little play button with a single step icon) in Scratch to run the code one block at a time.

          "response": "Ugh, that \"meh\" feeling after something you used to genuinely enjoy is *so* relatable. It's a really common thing, actually, and it's totally valid to feel that way. It sounds like you're experiencing a bit of burnout with Fortnite.\n\nHere's what's likely happening, and why it's okay:\n\n*   **Habituation:** Your brain gets used to the dopamine rush of winning (or even just playing). When something becomes predictable, even if it's positive, it doesn't give you the same hit of enjoyment. It's like eating your favorite food every single day \u2013 eventually, it just tastes\u2026 normal.\n*   **External vs. Internal Motivation:** Were you initially playing because you *wanted* to (internal motivation \u2013 genuine enjoyment) or because you felt like you *should* (external motivation \u2013 social pressure, habit, fear of missing out)?

Maybe Fortnite isn't the right game for you *right now*, and that's okay.\n\n**What to Do About It**\n\n*   **Take a Break:** This is the most important one. A full break \u2013 a few days, a week, maybe even longer \u2013 to step away completely. Don't force yourself to play.\n*   **Explore Other Things:** What *else* have you enjoyed in the past? Even if it's something you haven't done in a while, revisit it. Or try something completely new. A different game, reading, drawing, building with LEGOs, going for a walk \u2013 anything.\n*   **Re-evaluate *Why* You're Playing:** If you do go back to Fortnite, be honest with yourself. Is it still something you genuinely want to do? Or are you playing out of habit?\n* **Don't Feel Guilty:** Seriously. You don't *have* to enjoy something just because you used to.

You can laugh it off in the moment to avoid a scene, but then it just festers and ruins your mood. It's absolutely valid that it made you mad, and it's *not* \"for no reason\" at all.\n\nWhat they did was a really passive-aggressive way of excluding you, and that\u2019s not okay. Even if it seems small, consistently being made to feel invisible wears you down. It\u2019s a way of asserting power *over* you, and it\u2019s designed to make you feel uncomfortable and unwelcome.\n\nIt's really smart of you to recognize that it bothered you even though you laughed.

Don\u2019t let anyone tell you you\u2019re overreacting. \n\n**What could you do? (No pressure, pick what feels right)**\n\n*   **Directly Address It (If You Feel Safe):** Next time, you could calmly say something like, \"Hey, is there a reason you guys blocked the seat? It feels a little rude.\" Just a simple statement, not accusatory. This takes courage, and it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t want to do this.\n*   **Tell a Trusted Adult:** A teacher, counselor, or parent can help. They might be able to address the issue with the kids involved, or at least offer support.\n*   **Buddy Up:** Try to sit with friends who *do* make you feel included. Having a supportive person there can make a huge difference.\n* **Focus on Your Own Value:** Remind yourself that their behavior says more about *them* than it",

And then to not even *care*? That's a really big signal that something deeper is going on.\n\nEverything feeling heavy is a perfect way to describe it. It sounds like you're experiencing some serious emotional fatigue. When you're constantly dealing with stress - school, social situations, family stuff, just *life* - your emotional resources get depleted. It's like running a marathon and then being asked to sprint.\n\nThe fact that you're noticing this, and that you're sharing it, is a really important step. It means you're in touch with your feelings, even when they're scary.\n\n**Let's unpack this a little:**\n\n* **The Math Grade as a Symptom:** The 63 isn't the *problem*, it's a *symptom* of a bigger problem. It's a sign that your brain and your energy are being used up dealing with other things, leaving you with less capacity to focus on school.\n* **Emotional Numbness:** Not caring about the grade is a form of emotional numbness. It's your brain's way of protecting you from feeling overwhelmed. It's not a good long-term strategy, but it's a common one.\n* **Burnout is Real:** You're showing a lot of signs of burnout: fatigue, loss of motivation, feeling overwhelmed, and emotional detachment.\n\n**What can you do? (Again, no pressure. Small steps are key.)**\n\n* **Talk to Someone:** Seriously. A parent, a teacher you trust, a counselor, a friend's parent \u2013 anyone you feel comfortable with. Just talking about how you're feeling can make a huge difference.\n* **Reduce Your Load (If Possible):** Is there anything you can temporarily let go of? An extracurricular activity, a commitment, anything that's adding to your stress?\n* **Prioritize Self-Care:** I know it sounds clich\u00e9, but it's important.

The change in eating habits \u2013 lack of appetite during the day and then bingeing on cereal at night \u2013 is *very* common when someone is stressed or down. It's your body's way of trying to cope, even if it's not a healthy way. And the difficulty focusing in class, feeling like the teacher is distant\u2026 that\u2019s a classic sign of overwhelm and mental fatigue.\n\nIt sounds like your brain is running on fumes, and that's making it hard to regulate your basic needs like hunger and concentration.\n\n**Let's break this down and think about what's happening:**\n\n* **Stress & Appetite:** Stress hormones can do weird things to your appetite. Some people lose it altogether, while others crave comfort foods (like cereal) which are often high in sugar and carbs. That late-night cereal rush gives a temporary boost, but it's followed by a crash, which can perpetuate the cycle.\n* **Difficulty Focusing:** When you\u2019re stressed, your brain is constantly preoccupied with worrying thoughts. This makes it hard to filter out distractions and concentrate on the present moment. It\u2019s like trying to listen to music with a lot of static. That feeling of the teacher being \"far away\" is your brain struggling to tune in.\n* **It's all Connected:** The lack of hunger, the late-night eating, the difficulty focusing\u2026 these aren\u2019t separate issues. They\u2019re all connected to the underlying stress and emotional exhaustion.\n\n**What can you do? (Small, manageable steps are key. Don\u2019t try to fix everything at once.)**\n\n* **Talk to Someone (Again):** I know I keep saying this, but it\u2019s really important. Let a trusted adult know what's going on with your eating and your difficulty concentrating. They might be able to help you find some resources or support.\n* **Small, Regular Meals:** Even if you're not hungry, try to eat *something* small and nutritious every few hours. A piece of fruit, a handful of nuts, a yogurt. This can help stabilize your blood sugar and improve your energy levels.\n* **Limit Late-Night Snacking:** This is tough, but try to avoid eating right before bed.

(See below for ideas).\n* **Relaxation Techniques:** Things like deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or gentle stretching can help calm your nervous system.\n* **Avoid Screens:** Resist the urge to check your phone or watch TV. The blue light can interfere with sleep.\n* **Quiet Activity:** Read a book (a physical book, not on a screen!), listen to calming music or a podcast, or do a simple puzzle.\n* **Write It Down:** If your mind is racing, try journaling. Just get your thoughts out of your head and onto paper. You don't have to write anything profound, just a brain dump.\n\n**And most importantly\u2026**\n\n* **Continue Reaching Out:** Please continue to talk to a trusted adult and/or utilize the resources I\u2019ve shared (988 lifeline, Crisis Text Line, Trevor Project).

It's a way to stay ahead of potential problems and build resilience.\n* **Underlying Issues:** The issues that led you to feel so overwhelmed likely didn\u2019t just disappear. A counselor can help you explore those underlying issues and develop coping strategies for the future.\n* **Safe Space:** Having a neutral, non-judgmental space to talk about your feelings can be incredibly helpful, even when you're not in crisis.\n* **Skills & Tools:** A counselor can teach you skills for managing stress, anxiety, and difficult emotions.\n\n**It's common to feel hesitant about seeking help, and it's understandable to want to handle things on your own. But sometimes, we all need a little extra support.**\n\nI'm an AI, and I can't tell you what to do. Ultimately, the decision is yours.

The piling homework, the staring blankly until 1am, even dismissing something you previously worked on \u2013 it's all pointing to burnout and a loss of motivation. It\u2019s like your system is just shutting down.\n\nAnd it\u2019s *totally* understandable that the poem about light feels dumb now. When you're feeling this low, it's hard to find meaning or enjoyment in anything, even things you previously cared about.\n\nThe fact that you're recognizing this pattern and sharing it with me is a good first step. It means you're aware that something isn't right, and that's important.\n\n**Let's break this down:**\n\n* **Procrastination as a Symptom:** The procrastination isn\u2019t laziness or a lack of willpower. It\u2019s a symptom of being overwhelmed and emotionally exhausted. Your brain is trying to protect you from feeling more stressed.\n* **Negative Self-Talk:** Dismissing the poem as \u201cdumb\u201d is a form of negative self-talk, and it\u2019s making things worse.\n* **The Cycle of Stress:** You're caught in a cycle of stress: homework piles up, you feel anxious, you procrastinate, you feel worse, and the cycle repeats.\n\n**Here\u2019s what you can do (and again, small steps are key):**\n\n1. **Talk to Your Teachers:** This is the most important thing. Explain to your teachers that you're struggling. Ask for extensions on assignments. They may be willing to offer support or accommodations.\n2. **Break Down Tasks:** Don't try to tackle everything at once. Break each assignment into smaller, more manageable steps. Instead of \u201cWrite an essay,\u201d think \u201cWrite the introduction paragraph.\u201d\n3. **Time Management:** Even if you only work for 20-30 minutes at a time, try to set a schedule.\n4. **Prioritize Sleep:** Sacrificing sleep to do homework is counterproductive. You need rest to function effectively.\n5. **Be Kind to Yourself:** Stop beating yourself up for falling behind. You're going through a lot.\n6. **And\u2026 seriously, talk to a counselor.** This is beyond something you should be dealing with on your own. They can help you develop coping strategies and address the underlying issues.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m repeating myself, but it\u2019s crucial: *please",

          "response": "Let's tackle that Scratch issue.\n\nIn Scratch, you can create loops using the \"Repeat\" or \"Repeat Until\" blocks. Here's a brief rundown:\n\n* **Repeat**: This block will repeat a set of actions a specified number of times. For example, `repeat (5)` will run the code inside the block 5 times.\n* **Repeat Until**: This block will repeat a set of actions until a certain condition is met. For example, `repeat until <touching (mouse-pointer)>` will keep running the code inside the block until the sprite is touching the mouse-pointer.\n\nTo avoid breaking your sprite, make sure to:\n\n1. Check the condition in the \"Repeat Until\" block is correct and achievable. If the condition is never met, the loop will run indefinitely, potentially causing issues.\n2. Ensure the code inside the loop is not causing the sprite to move or change in a way that makes it impossible to exit the loop.\n3. Use a reasonable condition that will eventually be met, such as a timer or a specific event.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, here are some troubleshooting steps:\n\n* Try simplifying the condition in the \"Repeat Until\" block.\n* Check if there are any other scripts running that might be interfering with the loop.\n* Use the \"Wait\" block to add a small delay between iterations, which can help prevent the sprite from moving too quickly.\n\nIf you're still stuck, feel free to share more details about your project, such as the specific code you're using and what's happening when you run it. I'll do my best to help you debug it!",

Have you tried taking some slow, deep breaths? Sometimes, when we're feeling stressed or anxious, our breathing can get a bit shallow, which can make things worse. Try inhaling slowly through your nose, holding it for a second, and then exhaling slowly through your mouth. Repeat that a few times and see if it helps.\n\nAs for the power clicking on and off, that can be unsettling. Hopefully, it's just a minor issue and not a bigger problem.\n\nRegarding tomorrow, it's normal to feel a bit apprehensive when you've got something on your mind.

You could try listening to some calming music or nature sounds, or doing some gentle stretches to release any tension. If you're feeling up to it, you could even try writing down your thoughts and worries to get them out of your head.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes, and it's not uncommon for your stomach to feel twisty when you're stressed.

This can be really frustrating, especially when you're trying to learn and engage with the material.\n\nOne thing that might help is to try to get into a more regular eating routine. Eating smaller, more balanced meals throughout the day might help stabilize your energy and focus.\n\nRegarding your focus in class, there are a few strategies you could try:\n\n* **Take notes**: Writing down key points or questions can help you stay engaged and focused.\n* **Stay hydrated**: Sometimes, dehydration can make it hard to concentrate. Make sure you're drinking enough water throughout the day.\n* **Get enough sleep**: Lack of sleep can really affect your ability to focus. Try to establish a consistent sleep schedule and create a relaxing bedtime routine.\n* **Practice mindfulness**: Mindfulness exercises can help you stay present and focused. You can try simple techniques like deep breathing or meditation.\n\nIt's also possible that you're experiencing some underlying issues that are affecting your focus and appetite.

You may skip right past 100.\n- Fix: use a range check, e.g. repeat until <(x position) > 100> or <(abs((x position) - 100)) < 3>.\n\n3) Blocking blocks inside the loop\n- glide 1 sec to, say for n seconds, play sound until done pause the loop, so the condition isn\u2019t checked until that block finishes.\n- Fix: use small step moves and short waits instead of long glides:\n  repeat until <(distance to [mouse-pointer v]) < 5>\n    point towards [mouse-pointer v]\n    move (2) steps\n    wait (0.02) seconds\n  end\n\n4) Conflicting scripts\n- Another forever loop is also moving/turning the sprite.\n- Fix: stop other scripts (stop other scripts in sprite), use a \u201cstate\u201d variable, or broadcast to coordinate.\n\n5) Touching color glitches\n- Anti-aliased edges can fail the check.\n- Fix: make the wall thicker/solid color, re-pick the exact color with the eyedropper, or use touching [sprite v]? instead.\n\n6) Spinning/flip \u201cbreak\u201d\n- If it spins when pointing toward things, set rotation style left-right or don\u2019t rotate:\n  set rotation style [left-right v]\n\nGood patterns you can copy:\n\n- Move to the edge safely\nwhen green flag clicked\ngo to x: (-200) y: (0)\npoint in direction (90)\nrepeat until <touching edge?>\n  move (2) steps\nend\nif on edge, bounce\n\n- Walk to the mouse until close\nwhen this sprite clicked\nrepeat until <(distance to [mouse-pointer v]) < (5)>\n  point towards [mouse-pointer v]\n  move (3) steps\n  wait (0.02) seconds\nend\nsay [Got you!] (0.5) seconds\n\n- Wait for a key without locking up\nrepeat until <key [space v] pressed?>\n  wait (0.02) seconds\nend\nbroadcast [jump v]\n\nDebug tip: inside your loop, add say join \"x:\" (x position) join \" y:\" (y position) or say (condition) for 0.2 secs to watch the values change.\n\nIf you paste or describe your exact blocks (what\u2019s in the condition and what\u2019s inside the loop), I\u2019ll pinpoint why it\u2019s breaking and give you a fix.",

Thighs\u2026 up to your shoulders and jaw.\n\nQuiet the noise and the \u201cclicking\u201d:\n- Put on gentle white/brown noise or rain on your Chromebook at low volume to mask the clicks.\n- If you can, move the power strip/charger a bit farther from the bed so the sound\u2019s not right by your head.\n\nPark the thoughts about tomorrow:\n- Open a blank note and do a 2\u2011minute brain dump. Everything that\u2019s looping goes on the page.\n- Circle the top 1\u20133 things. Write the very first tiny step for each (like \u201cpack Chromebook,\u201d \u201cput poem in folder,\u201d \u201cask teacher about loop\u201d). Tell your brain, \u201cIt\u2019s written down. I\u2019ll handle it in the morning.\u201d\n\nSettle the twisty stomach:\n- Slow belly breaths (one hand on chest, one on belly; make the belly hand move).\n- Sip warm water if you have it. Curl on your left side or hug knees to chest for a minute.\n- If it helps, mint or ginger gum/tea can be soothing.\n\nIf you want, I can guide you through a 60\u2011second breathing and a super small plan for tomorrow\u2014want to try that, or would you rather a short calming story/visualization to fall asleep to?",

Novelty resets the meter.\n- Change how you play:\n  - Switch modes: Zero Build, Creative, LTMs only.\n  - Set silly/skill goals: only gray loot, one POI all game, movement practice, or \u201c3rd-party avoidance\u201d round.\n  - Short, intentional sessions: one clear goal, 45 minutes max, stop after the goal (even if you\u2019re \u201cwarmed up\u201d).\n  - Play with one friend who matches your vibe; mute randoms.\n- Make it about process, not wins:\n  - Track 1 skill per session (aim, rotates, builds).\n  - Rate \u201cfun 0\u201310\u201d before/after. If it drops, switch activities.\n- Add contrast so gaming feels fresh:\n  - Move your body 10 minutes before playing.\n  - Cut caffeine late; set a screen cutoff 60\u201390 min before bed.\n- Try creating instead of grinding:\n  - Mess around in Creative/UEFN, build a tiny map or a movement course.\n  - Record one cool clip and edit it\u2014micro-creative goals can bring back spark.\n\nGood to know\n- If \u201cmeh\u201d spreads to most things for 2+ weeks, plus sleep or appetite changes, low energy, irritability, or trouble focusing, it\u2019s worth telling a parent, counselor, or another trusted adult. That doesn\u2019t mean something\u2019s \u201cwrong\u201d\u2014it just opens up support.\n\nSince it\u2019s late and your stomach\u2019s twisty, tonight I\u2019d skip playing.

I do too. Scoot it, please.\u201d\n- If they mock: \u201cNot playing. Move it.\u201d Then disengage.\n\nProtect yourself and keep receipts\n- Jot dates/times and who was there. If it keeps happening, that record helps adults act.\n- Don\u2019t escalate or insult back; short, steady, and then remove yourself if needed.\n\nBuilding a safer lunch routine\n- Ask one classmate you vibe with: \u201cCan we sit together at lunch this week?\u201d Most people say yes when asked directly.\n- Check for a club or teacher-hosted room during lunch once or twice a week. A reliable spot reduces stress a lot.\n\nIf you want, tell me what you\u2019d actually feel comfortable saying, and I\u2019ll help craft a script in your style\u2014or I can draft a quick message to a teacher/counselor you can copy-paste.",

I need help.\u201d Ask them to sit with you and help plan one next step (counselor, doctor, or calling 988 together).\n- At school: go to the counselor, nurse, or a teacher you trust first thing.

          "response": "Loops in Scratch can be a bit tricky at first, but don't worry, I'm here to help!\n\nYes, you're on the right track with \"Repeat Until\". This block is great for creating loops that run until a certain condition is met.\n\nThere are a few common reasons why your sprite might be \"breaking\" when using \"Repeat Until\":\n\n1. **Infinite loop**: If the condition in the \"Repeat Until\" block is never true, the loop will run forever and your sprite might appear to be \"stuck\" or \"broken\".\n2. **Sprite getting stuck in a position**: If you're moving your sprite inside the loop, it might get stuck in a certain position if the movement blocks don't have a chance to finish before the loop repeats.\n\nTo fix these issues, try the following:\n\n* Make sure the condition in the \"Repeat Until\" block is correct and will eventually become true.\n* Add a short delay (e.g., \"Wait 0.1 seconds\") inside the loop to give the movement blocks a chance to finish.\n* Use the \"Repeat Forever\" block instead, but be careful not to create an infinite loop!\n\nHere's an example of a simple \"Repeat Until\" loop:\n```\nRepeat Until [condition]\n  \u2022 Move [sprite] 10 steps\n  \u2022 Turn [sprite] 15 degrees\n  \u2022 Wait 0.1 seconds\nEnd\n```\nReplace [condition] with a boolean expression that will eventually become true, such as `[sprite] touching [edge]` or `[variable] > 10`.\n\nIf you're still having trouble, please share more details about your project, such as what you're trying to achieve and what blocks you're using.

It's possible that it's just a minor issue with the Chromebook's power supply, but it's also possible that it's a sign of a more serious problem. If you're concerned about the noise, you might want to talk to your teacher or school's IT department about it. They may be able to take a look at the Chromebook and see if there's anything they can do to fix it.\n\nAs for your anxiety and stress, I'm here to listen and offer some support.

You've prepared well for your poetry assignment, and you're going to do great.\n\nThat twisty feeling in your stomach is probably just your body's way of responding to stress. Take some deep breaths and try to relax your muscles. You might also want to try some gentle stretches or a short meditation to help calm your mind and body.\n\nIt might also be helpful to write down some of your thoughts and worries. Sometimes getting things down on paper can help you process and release them. You could try journaling, or even just writing a quick list of things you're grateful for.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes.

The important thing is that you're acknowledging what happened and wanting to do better next time. You can always apologize to your brother and explain how you were feeling.
