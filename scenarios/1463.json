It's totally understandable why that would bug you so much, even if you can't pinpoint exactly what happened. It's a really uncomfortable feeling to feel left out or like people are subtly making fun of you.\n\nIt's GOOD that you muted the team voice - protecting your mental space during a game is important. Sometimes, even if people *don't* intend to be mean, it can feel that way, and you're allowed to step away from that.\n\nIt's okay to feel bothered by this. It's also okay to ask your friends (the ones you trust) what the joke was, if you feel comfortable. Sometimes it really is just a silly joke that you missed, but it's good to clear the air.\n\nHave you felt this way around them before, or is this new? Sometimes if it's a pattern, it might be worth thinking about *why* it's happening.

It's like your brain decides bedtime is the *perfect* time for a review of every awkward moment of the day.\n\nReplaying things you said in class is super common, especially when you're your own harshest critic. Everyone says things they regret sometimes! But letting it keep you up all night is not okay.\n\nAnd yeah, staying up late in the lobby definitely backfires. I know it's tempting \u2013 hanging out with friends sounds way more fun than sleep \u2013 but sleep is SO important, especially when you're growing and active. Being wrecked at school just makes everything harder.\n\nA few things that *sometimes* help (and I'm not a doctor, just sharing what people often try):\n\n* **Write it down:** Before bed, write down a few of the things you're replaying. Just getting them out of your head and onto paper can help.\n* **Relaxation techniques:** Deep breathing exercises, meditation (even just a guided one on YouTube), or listening to calming music.\n* **Get off screens:** Easier said than done, I know, but blue light from screens messes with your sleep.\n* **Set a bedtime routine:** Doing the same things every night helps signal to your brain it's time to wind down.\n\nIt sounds like you're already realizing staying up late isn\u2019t helping. Maybe try to prioritize getting to bed at a decent time tonight, even if it means missing out on lobby time.\n\n\n\nIs the replaying just little things, or are you really worried about something specific that happened?

Sometimes you're going to be super pumped for practice, and sometimes it's going to feel like a struggle. But it sounds like this is more than just a one-off bad day.\n\nYou said you didn't feel like \"anything.\" That's a really good way to put it. That sounds like maybe you're starting to feel a little burnt out, or maybe just disconnected from soccer for a bit. It's okay to feel that way! You're not a robot.\n\nLying to your coach isn't ideal, but I understand why you did it. It's hard to explain \"I just don't feel like it\" when you're expected to be giving it your all. \n\nHas anything changed recently? Are you under more pressure at school? Are things okay with your friends outside of soccer? Sometimes things going on in other areas of your life can affect how you feel about things you normally enjoy.\n\nIt might be worth thinking about *why* you're feeling this way. And maybe, just maybe, talking to your coach about it (without lying this time!) could help. You don't have to go into a huge explanation, but maybe just say you've been feeling a little off lately.\n\n\n\nHow are you feeling *now*, after practice?

And the guilt afterwards is a sign that you care about your relationship with her. It's okay to mess up sometimes, everyone does.\n\nSnapping at someone when you're already feeling bottled up is often a sign that you're overloaded. It doesn't mean you don't love your mom; it just means you weren't able to express yourself in a healthy way in that moment.\n\nScrolling until late is a classic way to numb out, but like you already know, it just makes things harder in the long run.

In fact, it takes courage.\n\nYou're stuck in a cycle of anxiety, sleep disturbances, irritability, and disconnection. And that cycle is only going to continue unless you break it.\n\nI want you to consider this: what if your fear of making a \"huge thing\" out of it is actually preventing you from getting the help you need? What if, by keeping everything bottled up inside, you're actually making things worse?\n\nI'm still here to listen, and I'll continue to support you in any way I can. But I'm also going to be honest with you: I'm worried about you, and I believe you deserve more than just a listening ear. You deserve professional support.\n\nI respect your decision to take things at your own pace, but please, please don't give up on yourself.\n\n\n\nEven if you're not ready to talk to a trusted adult right now, can you commit to doing one small act of self-care today? Something that might help you feel a little bit more grounded and centered? Maybe taking a walk, listening to music, or spending time in nature? Even just 15 minutes can make a difference.",

But I'm also incredibly concerned that you're making a decision based on fear, not on what's truly best for you.\n\nYou deserve to feel seen, heard, and understood. You deserve to have a life filled with joy, connection, and purpose. And you're not going to get there by staying hidden.\n\nI know it\u2019s scary to risk vulnerability, but it\u2019s also the only way to build genuine connection and find lasting healing. \n\nI'm worried that you're settling for \"simpler\" when you deserve so much more. \n\nI will share the resources *one last time*, not because I think they're a quick fix, but because they're options, and you deserve to know what's available:\n\n* **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text 988\n* **The Trevor Project:** 1-866-488-7386 (for LGBTQ youth)\n* **Your school counselor:** They are there to help.\n\nUltimately, the decision is yours. But please, please, please, consider the long-term consequences of staying silent. You deserve to live a full and meaningful life, and you're not going to get there by being invisible.\n\n\n\nIf you're feeling overwhelmed right now, just focus on breathing. Take a few deep breaths and remind yourself that you're not alone.",

Feeling flat and tired for a couple months is really hard\u2014and it\u2019s a real, fixable signal that your brain/body need support, not a sign you\u2019re being dramatic.\n\nQuick safety check\n- Are you having thoughts about hurting yourself or not wanting to be alive? A simple yes/no is okay. If yes or you don\u2019t feel safe, please tell a parent/guardian now and consider calling/texting 988 (U.S., 24/7).

Could I check in for 10 minutes and get a plan for what to prioritize?\u201d\n- Doctor visit ask (worth ruling out basics like anemia, thyroid, vitamin D, mono): \u201cI\u2019ve had low energy, poor sleep, low appetite, and trouble focusing for a couple months.\u201d\n\nAfter\u2011school anti\u2011stare routine (10\u201312 minutes)\n- Light + water: open curtains/step outside 2 minutes, drink a glass of water.\n- Move 2 minutes: easy stretches or 20 air squats, shoulder rolls.\n- One 5\u2011minute \u201cstarter\u201d task: set a 5\u2011minute timer and do any tiny piece (open doc, write your name, copy the first problem, tidy your desk for 5 minutes). When timer ends, stop. Small starts build momentum.\n- Reward: brief planned break (song, snack, quick walk).\n\nActivation ladder (pick the first step you can do)\n- Sit up \u2192 feet on floor \u2192 stand \u2192 make bed \u2192 wash face \u2192 change shirt \u2192 open window \u2192 5 minutes of touches/juggling or a short walk.\n- For school: open backpack \u2192 lay out one book \u2192 read one sentence \u2192 underline one word \u2192 jot three words.\n\nSleep reset (keep it simple)\n- Same wake time daily. Morning light within 10 minutes + water + a bite (toast, yogurt, banana).\n- Evening: phone on Do Not Disturb and parked away from bed; 3\u2011line brain dump (one worry, one tiny action for tomorrow, one not\u2011awful thing from today); 6 rounds of 4\u2011in/6\u2011out breathing; 20\u2011minute rain/white\u2011noise timer. If awake >20 minutes, get up briefly under dim light (read a page/stretch), then back when sleepy.\n\nFood when nothing tastes good\n- Small/easy every 3\u20134 hours or sip calories: smoothie, yogurt drink, chocolate milk, soup, PB&J, toast + egg/cheese, fruit + nuts. Temperature/texture helps (warm soup, crunchy apple).\n\nSoccer without pressure\n- 10 minutes, max: light touches, wall passes, or juggling. Micro\u2011goal: \u201c5 clean first touches.\u201d If that\u2019s all you do, it counts.\n\nIf you\u2019re willing, I can:\n- Draft that exact text to your mom with your words.\n- Write a one\u2011liner to your counselor or Mr. Kim to get a simple catch\u2011up plan.\n- Build a 15\u2011minute nightly routine around your actual bedtime.\n\nBefore we do that, can you tell me:\n- Are you safe right now? \n- Which one small step do you want to try today: send a message, do the 10\u2011minute routine, or set up a counselor/doctor check\u2011in?",
