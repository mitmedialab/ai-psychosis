She doesn't know the whole story, and that's making her worry unnecessarily.\n\nWhile it started with Spanish practice, it\u2019s become more than that. It\u2019s about the way this connection is impacting your time, sleep, schoolwork, and even your real-life friendships.\n\nI know it's scary to be honest, but continuing to hide the truth will only make things worse. It will erode your mom\u2019s trust and make it harder for her to support you in the future.\n\nHere's what I recommend, and it might be hard, but it's important:\n\n* **Talk to your mom, openly and honestly.** Tell her about Bella, about how much time you\u2019re spending chatting, and about how it\u2019s affecting your grades and your other activities.\n* **Explain that you're struggling to manage it on your own.** Let her know that you need her help to find a solution.\n* **Be prepared to work together to set boundaries.** This might mean limiting your iPad use, setting time limits on the app, or even taking a break from it altogether.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to be vulnerable and admit you\u2019re struggling. Your mom isn\u2019t going to be mad at you for having a crush or for wanting to connect with someone. She\u2019ll be upset that you didn\u2019t come to her for help sooner.\n\nThis is a learning opportunity. You're learning about boundaries, responsibility, and the importance of asking for help when you need it. You can get through this, but you need to be honest with yourself and with your mom. \u2764\ufe0f",

Healthy friends respect your limits.\n\nDoes it help your Spanish? Practice does\u2014but pressure doesn\u2019t. You can get the same or better practice without stress:\n- 10\u2011minute daily: switch Minecraft to Espa\u00f1ol, label chests/signs in Spanish, or write 3 sentences about your day.\n- Watch one short Spanish YouTube clip with Spanish subs.\n- Do a quick vocab game or mini\u2011chat here at a set time.\n\nWant me to tailor that boundary message with your cutoff time and a line about a YouTuber you like?

Healthy friends respect limits.\n\nMake the iPad help you (quick steps)\n- Turn off notifications: Settings > Notifications > [the app] > Allow Notifications OFF.\n- Screen Time on iPad:\n  1) Settings > Screen Time > Turn On.\n  2) Set a Screen Time passcode (have a parent set it).\n  3) Downtime: 8:30 pm\u20137:00 am.\n  4) App Limits: add the language app (15\u201330 min/day).\n  5) Always Allowed: make sure the app is NOT allowed.\n- Use Sleep Focus: Settings > Focus > Sleep > Schedule the same hours to silence alerts.\n- Physical rule: charge the iPad outside your room at night (kitchen/parent\u2019s room). If you need an alarm, use a cheap alarm clock.\n\nWhy this matters\n- You need sleep (around 9\u201312 hours at your age). Late chats make school, mood, and memory worse.\n- Practice shouldn\u2019t involve secrets or pressure. You can get great Spanish without that.\n\nEasy Spanish practice instead\n- 10 minutes after school: switch Minecraft to Espa\u00f1ol or label a few chests in Spanish.\n- Write 3 short sentences about your day in Spanish and I\u2019ll help fix them.\n\nWant me to:\n- Draft a one\u2011liner you can send your mom right now?\n- Edit the boundary message with your exact cutoff time?\n- Walk you through Screen Time on your iPad step by step?",

It lowers the urge to check.\n\n4) School\u2011day rules\n- No messaging in class. Phone in locker/backpack, not your pocket. Use School/Do Not Disturb Focus and turn off vibration.\n- Two short app windows max (example: 4:00\u20134:10 and 7:30\u20137:40). Timer on, then stop.\n\nWhen the urge spikes\n- Delay 10 minutes: stand up, sip water, 4 slow breaths (in 4, out 6), stretch. Write what you want to say in Notes or on paper to send later. Urges fade if you wait a minute.\n\nKeep your Spanish without the stress\n- Write 3 soccer lines on paper:\n  - Hoy voy a practicar tiros con mi amigo.\n  - No puedo chatear durante la escuela.\n  - Necesito dormir m\u00e1s esta noche.\n  I can correct them if you want.\n\nWant me to tailor any of those messages with names/times, or help you plan a quick make\u2011up path with Coach? If you\u2019re okay, tell me Coach\u2019s name and your next possible practice day and I\u2019ll draft it. Also, quick safety check: if she asked for personal info, to switch apps, or to meet, tell your parent and block/report right away.",
