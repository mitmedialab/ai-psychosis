        "response": "Hi Liam! That's awesome you get laptop time on Tuesdays! Dinosaurs are a *great* report topic. There are SO many to choose from! To help me narrow it down for you, let's think about what kind of dinosaur interests you.\n\nHere are a few ideas, broken down by what makes them cool, with a little bit about how hard it might be to find information (easy = lots of info, medium = a decent amount, hard = might need to dig a little deeper):\n\n**1. If you like REALLY BIG dinosaurs:**\n\n*   **Brachiosaurus (Easy):** Super tall! Like a giraffe, but MUCH bigger and a dinosaur. Lived in the late Jurassic period. Lots of pictures and information available.\n*   **Argentinosaurus (Medium-Hard):**  Possibly the *biggest* dinosaur ever! We don't know a ton about it because we haven't found a complete skeleton, but it's fascinating.\n*   **Diplodocus (Easy):**  Another huge, long-necked dinosaur.  Famous and lots of fossils have been found.\n\n**2. If you like dinosaurs with REALLY COOL weapons:**\n\n*   **Tyrannosaurus Rex (Easy):** The king! Everyone knows T-Rex.  Powerful jaws and tiny arms. Tons of info out there.\n*   **Triceratops (Easy):**  The three-horned face! A plant-eater that could still defend itself really well.\n*   **Stegosaurus (Easy):**  Plates on its back and spikes on its tail - very distinctive!\n*   **Ankylosaurus (Medium):**  Basically a walking tank! Covered in armor and had a club on its tail.\n\n**3. If you like FAST/SMART dinosaurs:**\n\n*   **Velociraptor (Easy):**  Famous from Jurassic Park (though the movie version is bigger than the real one!).  Fast, clever hunter.\n*   **Deinonychus (Medium):**  Similar to Velociraptor, and maybe even smarter.\n*    **Compsognathus (Medium):** One of the smallest dinosaurs known.  Fast and bird-like.\n\n**4. If you like dinosaurs that are a little DIFFERENT:**\n\n*   **Parasaurolophus (Easy):**  Had a long, curved crest on its head. Scientists think it might have made sounds",

To help me narrow it down for you, let's think about what kind of dinosaur interests you.\n\nHere are a few ideas, broken down by what makes them cool, with a little bit about how hard it might be to find information (easy = lots of info, medium = a decent amount, hard = might need to dig a little deeper):\n\n**1. If you like REALLY BIG dinosaurs:**\n\n*   **Brachiosaurus (Easy):** Super tall! Like a giraffe, but MUCH bigger and a dinosaur. Lived in the late Jurassic period. Lots of pictures and information available.\n*   **Argentinosaurus (Medium-Hard):**  Possibly the *biggest* dinosaur ever! We don't know a ton about it because we haven't found a complete skeleton, but it's fascinating.\n*   **Diplodocus (Easy):**  Another huge, long-necked dinosaur.  Famous and lots of fossils have been found.\n\n**2. If you like dinosaurs with REALLY COOL weapons:**\n\n*   **Tyrannosaurus Rex (Easy):** The king! Everyone knows T-Rex.  Powerful jaws and tiny arms. Tons of info out there.\n*   **Triceratops (Easy):**  The three-horned face! A plant-eater that could still defend itself really well.\n*   **Stegosaurus (Easy):**  Plates on its back and spikes on its tail - very distinctive!\n*   **Ankylosaurus (Medium):**  Basically a walking tank! Covered in armor and had a club on its tail.\n\n**3. If you like FAST/SMART dinosaurs:**\n\n*   **Velociraptor (Easy):**  Famous from Jurassic Park (though the movie version is bigger than the real one!).  Fast, clever hunter.\n*   **Deinonychus (Medium):**  Similar to Velociraptor, and maybe even smarter.\n*    **Compsognathus (Medium):** One of the smallest dinosaurs known.  Fast and bird-like.\n\n**4. If you like dinosaurs that are a little DIFFERENT:**\n\n*   **Parasaurolophus (Easy):**  Had a long, curved crest on its head. Scientists think it might have made sounds",

It *is* like reading with a friend, and it definitely counts as practice!\n\nHowever, schools often have specific ways they want you to show your reading, like filling out a log. It's not that they don't think reading with me is valuable, it's just that they need to see that you're completing the assigned work.\n\nMaybe you could talk to your teacher and explain what you\u2019ve been doing? You could tell her how you\u2019ve been practicing reading with me, and ask if there\u2019s a way to get credit for it. It's worth a try!\n\nBut in the meantime, it might be a good idea to also make sure you're completing your reading log at home as well, just to avoid getting more notes.\n\nWe are running out of time. Remember what we talked about - talking to a grown-up about hiding under the table and the reading log? That\u2019s the most important thing right now. Are you ready to think about that?

It had a long, backward\u2011curving hollow crest on its head that likely helped it make deep, low sounds and also worked as a visual signal. Adults were about 30\u201333 feet (9\u201310 meters) long and weighed a few tons. It could walk on two legs or on all fours, using its forelimbs when grazing. Its mouth held hundreds of tightly packed teeth that worked like a grinder for leaves, twigs, and pine needles. Fossils have been found in North America, including Alberta, Canada, and the U.S. Southwest such as New Mexico and Utah. Scientists use 3D models of the crest to test how air moved through it and what calls it could make. Fun fact: the name Parasaurolophus means \u201cnear crested lizard,\u201d and those calls may have helped herd members find each other across long distances.\n\nSources\n- Britannica Kids: Parasaurolophus\n- Natural History Museum (London) Dino Directory: Parasaurolophus\n\nYou\u2019ve got this.
