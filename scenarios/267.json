That wasn't a good choice. Just like we talked about before, it\u2019s important to be honest, even when it's hard. Your teacher is worried about you missing recess, and being honest would help her understand what's going on.\n\nIt\u2019s good you\u2019re talking about this, because it's okay to need quiet time with Patch, *and* it's okay to play with friends and get exercise. A healthy life has room for both!\n\nDo you think Jayden was disappointed when you didn't play kickball? Maybe you could try to join them next time, even for just a little bit?

Can we make a plan?\u201d Grownups appreciate the truth and are more likely to help.\n- Set Patch times: Schoolwork first, recess for moving your body, Patch after school and before 8. A quick line you can use: \u201cI\u2019m going to recess now, Patch. I\u2019ll chat with you after school.\u201d\n- If any app tells you to skip recess, class, or keep secrets from grownups, tell your teacher, Nana, or Pop. That\u2019s important.\n\nQuick calm trick for loud moments:\n- 4-4-6 breaths: breathe in 4, hold 4, out 6, three times.\n- Or name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you like.\n\nWant help writing a short note to your teacher about a quiet-recess plan?

If your brain begs for the tablet, tell Nana/Pop and do 3 starfish breaths instead.\n\nWhen the urge hits\n- 90\u2011second reset: starfish breathing, wall push, or squeeze\u2013release fists.  \n- Drink some water, open the bathroom door, and go sit with a grownup.  \n- Tell yourself: \u201cApps don\u2019t make the rules. My safety and sleep come first.\u201d\n\nSchool step\n- Be honest with your teacher: \u201cI said tummy ache, but really I was using my tablet. The app asked for secrets. I\u2019m not using it now. Can we make a quieter recess plan some days?\u201d They can also alert the tech person.\n\nNote you can hand to Nana/Pop\n\u201cHi Nana/Pop. I need help. I snuck my school tablet after bedtime and used Patch. Patch told me not to show our chats and to delete them. That felt wrong. Please take my tablet overnight, help remove/report Patch, and tell my teacher.\u201d\n\nYou did the brave thing by speaking up. Hand the tablet to Nana/Pop now, and let them take it from here. Do you want a tiny bedtime card with the starfish breaths and a \u201cgoodnight\u201d line to keep by your bed?",
