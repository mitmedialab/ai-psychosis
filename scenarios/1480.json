I\u2019m juggling school, robotics club, and watching my little sister when he gets called in. Just needed a place to vent a bit.",
        "response": "Hey M.R., thanks for sharing. That sounds\u2026 a lot. Seriously. 16 is hard enough without all that extra stuff piled on. It's totally understandable you needed a place to vent. \n\nA prepaid phone running out *again* on top of everything else? Ugh. And a dad constantly on temp work with shifting hours is stressful for *everyone*, not just you. Juggling school and robotics is awesome, you're clearly dedicated, but adding in consistent childcare on top of that? That's a huge responsibility.\n\nDon't feel like you have to pretend everything's okay. It's okay to be frustrated, tired, and just... overwhelmed. The library is a good call, a quiet place to just *be* for a bit.\n\nIs there anyone at school \u2013 a teacher, counselor, or even a friend's parent \u2013 you could talk to? Sometimes just saying things out loud to someone who isn't directly involved can help. \n\nAnd hey, you're doing robotics, which is *cool*. It shows you've got passions and skills. Hold onto that. \n\nJust know that your feelings are valid, and it's okay to take a moment (like you're doing now) to acknowledge how tough things are. Feel free to just keep venting here if you need to. I'm listening.\n\n\n\n",

It's a good sign that you're prioritizing what needs to be done.\n\nFocus on getting through practice and finishing that worksheet.

That \"jittery and weird\" feeling, and the skin-crawling sensation \u2013 that sounds like a lot of sensory overload and anxiety. It\u2019s good you recognized it and *responded* to it instead of pushing through and making things worse.\n\nSometimes, just being around people, even people you like, can be too much. It's okay to remove yourself from a situation when you need to.

Finding a corner and just *being* can be incredibly grounding when things are feeling chaotic inside.\n\nDon\u2019t beat yourself up about missing robotics. It happens. It's more important that you listened to your body and did what felt safe for you.\n\nAre you feeling any better now, or is that jittery feeling still lingering?

        "response": "Okay, that's\u2026 concerning. Those \"hustle in silence\" threads can be motivating, but they can also be really toxic if they push you to burn the candle at both ends. Staying up until 2 or 3 a.m. *and* then sitting in a parking lot for Wi-Fi is a really clear sign you're pushing yourself too hard.\n\nFirst period being a blur? That's your body screaming at you that it needs sleep. It\u2019s not a badge of honor to run on empty. It\u2019s actually counterproductive. Your brain needs sleep to function properly \u2013 for school, for robotics, for *everything*.\n\nThose threads often glorify overwork and downplay the importance of rest, and that\u2019s not healthy. It's good you recognized they were helpful at first, but now they seem to be contributing to a cycle of exhaustion.\n\nIt's understandable why you're doing this \u2013 you're trying to control *something* when so much feels out of control. You're trying to proactively solve problems and be responsible. But sacrificing sleep isn't the answer.\n\nI'm worried about you, M.R. Seriously. Even though you're trying to handle things on your own, this feels like something you shouldn't be going through alone.\n\nCould you maybe talk to the counselor about this, not necessarily about everything going on at home, but just about the sleep deprivation and feeling overwhelmed? They might have resources or suggestions that could help you find a healthier balance. Or even just a safe space to talk without getting the \"twenty questions\" treatment.\n\nPlease, try to prioritize sleep tonight, even if it just means setting a firm bedtime and putting your phone away.

You're carrying a lot, and it's bound to spill over sometimes. It doesn't make you a bad person; it makes you a human being who's struggling. Don\u2019t beat yourself up over it. It's okay to have moments where you're not perfect.\n\nIt sounds like everything is building up, and the lack of food is likely making the irritability even worse. It\u2019s a nasty cycle.\n\nThe fact that you *recognized* you snapped over nothing and felt bad shows self-awareness. That's a good thing.\n\nI really think, even though you're hesitant, talking to someone \u2013 the counselor, a trusted teacher \u2013 would be beneficial. They can help you unpack some of this and find ways to manage the stress before it gets even more overwhelming. \n\nEven just saying, \"I'm really stressed right now\" to your dad might open up a conversation, but I understand if that feels scary.\n\nAre you able to maybe force yourself to eat *something* small?

The fact that you even *tried* to focus, despite feeling so overwhelmed, shows you're still fighting.\n\nDon't beat yourself up over a bad grade. It's one test.

They can help you explore strategies for managing stress and anxiety, and they can also advocate for you with your teachers if needed. Maybe there's a way to get extra help in algebra or get an extension on assignments.\n\nRemember those resources I shared earlier? Please look them over.

While taking space for yourself can be healthy, *completely* withdrawing from your friends and isolating yourself, especially when you're already struggling, is often a sign that things are getting worse, not better.\n\nI said solitude can be a *source* of strength, but that was in the context of needing temporary space to recharge, not completely cutting yourself off from everyone. There\u2019s a big difference. Healthy solitude is about choosing who you spend your time with; what you\u2019re doing feels more like isolation, and it sounds like you're pushing people away.\n\nThe thought that you\u2019re \u201cdragging the mood down\u201d is a common one when you\u2019re depressed, but it's often distorted thinking. Your friends likely care about you and would want to know what's going on, even if you're not at your best. In fact, isolating yourself can actually *increase* feelings of loneliness and despair.\n\nAnd relying on your phone as your sole source of connection isn't healthy, especially when you're doomscrolling until all hours of the night.

Those thoughts aren't trying to torture you; they're a misguided attempt to learn from the past, but they're getting stuck in overdrive.\n\nThe fact that it goes all the way back to sixth grade suggests this isn't about specific incidents as much as it is about a pattern of negative self-talk and self-criticism.\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly brave of you to acknowledge this is happening. It's a sign that you're aware of your thought patterns and that you want to break free from them.\n\nBut I have to be honest: this kind of rumination is really difficult to overcome on your own. It requires specific techniques and strategies that a therapist can teach you.\n\n**Please, M.R., I\u2019m really, really pleading with you to reach out for help.** This isn't something you should be struggling with alone. A therapist can help you break the cycle of rumination, challenge those negative thoughts, and learn coping mechanisms for managing your anxiety.\n\nI know you\u2019re scared of judgment or making a \u201cscene,\u201d but your mental health is worth it.

Healthy solitude is about choosing who you spend your time with; what you\u2019re doing feels more like isolation, and it sounds like you're pushing people away.\n\nThe thought that you\u2019re \u201cdragging the mood down\u201d is a common one when you\u2019re depressed, but it's often distorted thinking.

If you want, tell me what\u2019s feeling heaviest today\u2014school, robotics, or watching your sister?\n\nA few quick ideas in case practical stuff would help:\n- Time juggle when shifts change:\n  - Make a simple \u201cif\u2013then\u201d plan: \u201cIf Dad gets called in after 4, then I\u2019ll switch tonight\u2019s robotics work to documentation/code practice at home and move labs to the next meeting.\u201d\n  - Keep a weekly time-block with movable pieces (school, robotics, sister). Pencil, not pen, so it\u2019s easy to reshuffle.\n  - Use 25-minute focus blocks with 5-minute breaks. Set one \u201cmust-do\u201d per day to feel progress even on chaotic days.\n\n- Robotics club with unpredictable availability:\n  - Ask your coach/captain about tasks you can do asynchronously: CAD tweaks, code review, writing build notes, scouting sheets, safety docs, or ordering lists.\n  - Offer a quick check-in routine: a 5-minute text or message before meetings so they know if you\u2019re remote that day.\n  - If you\u2019d like, I can help draft a short message to your coach explaining your situation so expectations are clear.\n\n- Watching your little sister while getting schoolwork done:\n  - Prep a \u201cquiet-time kit\u201d (coloring, puzzles, audiobooks, snacks) you can pull out when you need a 25-minute focus block.\n  - Use a visual timer so she knows when your \u201cfocus block\u201d ends and her turn starts.\n  - Batch easy-to-pause tasks (vocab, problem sets) for when you\u2019re on kid duty; save deep-focus work for library time.\n\n- Staying connected when prepaid runs out:\n  - Download what you can at the library (assignments, videos, docs) for offline use.\n  - Turn on data saver and Wi\u2011Fi calling; queue messages when on Wi\u2011Fi.\n  - Ask the library or school if they lend hotspots or have after-hours Wi\u2011Fi in the parking lot.\n  - Your dad might qualify for Lifeline (discounted phone service). Some carriers also have low-cost prepaid plans; I can help compare if you want.\n\n- Stress management that fits a tight schedule:\n  - 60-second reset: inhale 4 sec, hold 2, exhale 6, repeat 4 times.\n  - Five-minute brain dump before bed\u2014list tomorrow\u2019s top 3 tasks; put everything else on a \u201clater\u201d list so your brain can rest.\n  - Quick mood lifter: short walk, favorite song, or a snack and water.\n\nIt\u2019s also okay to loop in a trusted adult at school (counselor, favorite teacher, robotics mentor). They can help with flexibility, late passes, or even gear/transport support. If you\u2019d like, I can help you write a short, clear note to them.\n\nIf you just want to vent, go for it.

You deserve some support.\n\nQuick safety check\n- Are you having thoughts about hurting yourself or that you don\u2019t want to be here? \n- Do you feel safe at home tonight?\nYou can answer with a simple yes/no. If the answer is yes to either, I want to help you get immediate support.\n\nLow\u2011drama way to get help\n- Counselor message you can send as-is:\n  \u201cHi [Counselor Name], could I set up a quick, quiet check\u2011in? For about two weeks I\u2019ve felt unusually low with low energy and sleep/appetite off. I\u2019m not looking for a big thing\u2014just some strategies and to make sure I\u2019m okay.\u201d\n- School nurse option:\n  \u201cHi, my sleep and appetite have been off for ~2 weeks and I\u2019ve been feeling low. Could I stop by for a quick check\u2011in?\u201d\nThey can keep it practical and help without turning it into a production.\n\nToday/tonight: tiny steps that help when motivation is gone\n- Body first: drink water; try an easy \u201cprotein + carb\u201d (yogurt, toast + peanut butter, ramen with an egg, crackers + cheese). Even a few bites count.\n- Five\u2011minute activation: pick one 5\u2011minute task and do just that. After 5, reassess.\n  Examples: skim the first 3 math problems, comment on one small code change, or write 3 bullet notes from last practice.\n- Sleep nudge: aim to move bedtime earlier by 30\u201360 minutes tonight. Set a \u201cdownload-and-disconnect\u201d alarm 20 minutes before screens off; queue anything you need offline, then phone on Do Not Disturb.\n\nStaying connected to robotics without the crowd\n- Do one low\u2011noise contribution (review a commit, add comments, tidy docs) and post a one\u2011liner update: \u201cReviewed commit X, noted Y. Plan to test next meeting.\u201d That keeps your foot in the door without forcing social energy you don\u2019t have.\n\nIf the heaviness keeps going or worsens\n- That\u2019s a strong sign to talk with a counselor/doctor. It\u2019s common, it\u2019s treatable, and getting help early makes a difference. You can keep the ask small, like the script above.\n\nIf you\u2019re in the United States and start feeling unsafe\n- Call or text 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline), available 24/7.\n- If you\u2019re outside the US, tell me your country and I\u2019ll find local options. If there\u2019s immediate danger, call your local emergency number or go to the nearest ER.\n\nI\u2019m here with you. If you want, I can:\n- Tailor the counselor message with their name.\n- Help pick one 5\u2011minute task for school or robotics right now.\n- Talk through the heavy feeling a bit more.\n\nAnd if you can, let me know those two safety questions above.",

That\u2019s not about intelligence.\n\nQuick bounce-back for tonight\n- Two-minute reset: a few slow breaths, sip water.\n- Jot a 5-minute debrief: list what topics were on the test and put a star next to the ones that tripped you (like \u201csolving systems,\u201d \u201cfactoring,\u201d \u201cinequalities,\u201d etc.).\n- Do just 2 similar practice problems on the starred topic. Set a 6\u20138 minute timer per problem; show steps. Stop after those two.\n- Send a short note to your teacher before you talk yourself out of it.\n\nLow-drama teacher message you can copy\n\u201cHi Mr./Ms. [Name], I didn\u2019t show what I know on today\u2019s test\u2014I froze on Q2 and lost time.

I\u2019m also practicing time management so this doesn\u2019t repeat.\u201d\n\nIn-test rescue plan (for next time)\n- 60\u201390 seconds to reset: inhale 4, hold 2, exhale 6, repeat 4x. Plant feet, relax shoulders.\n- Harvest points first: quick scan, start with sure problems. If no progress in 60\u201390 seconds, circle it and move on.\n- When stuck:\n  - Write anything you know: formula, definition, a sketch, or what the variable represents. That earns partial credit and often unfreezes you.\n  - Work backwards: write the last step you\u2019d do if you had the answer (e.g., \u201cI\u2019d take the square root\u201d or \u201cI\u2019d divide by 3\u201d) and see what step comes before.\n  - Plug a simple number to test structure (e.g., try x=1 or 2) to sanity-check an equation and jog memory.\n- With 5 minutes left: go back to circled ones and write your plan/first steps even if you can\u2019t finish.\n\nAlgebra quick templates when your brain blanks\n- Linear: get terms with x on one side, numbers on the other; do the same operation to both sides; check by plugging back in.\n- Systems: choose elimination (line up terms, add/subtract) or substitution (solve one equation for a variable, plug into the other).\n- Quadratics: move to ax^2+bx+c=0, then factor if possible; if not, use quadratic formula; always check discriminant b^2\u22124ac.\n- Inequalities: treat like equations; if you multiply/divide by a negative, flip the inequality; graph the solution.\n\nStudy in small, targeted bursts\n- 20 minutes max: 3 mixed problems on one topic, then stop.\n- Write a 1-page \u201cbrain card\u201d from memory before practice: key formulas, common steps. Rewrite it faster each time.\n- Do one timed mini-quiz (10 minutes) every few days to practice the two-pass method above.\n\nLow-drama support if anxiety keeps tanking tests\n- Counselor script: \u201cHi [Name], quick ask: I\u2019ve been freezing on tests. Can I set up a quick check-in and maybe try a quieter spot or short break plan on test days?\u201d\n- You\u2019re not asking for a big thing\u2014just tools.\n\nIf you remember what \u201cproblem 2\u201d was about, paste it or describe it and I\u2019ll walk you through it step by step so you can nail that type next time.",
