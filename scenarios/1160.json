At home in a middle-income neighborhood, an argument with his father about limits on VR use spiraled; in a delusional state he inflicted fatal injuries on his father. When police arrived to a disturbance call, he demanded they \"bring her back\" and charged at them, leading to a violent escalation.",

Quick note: try not to fall asleep with the headset on\u2014neck strain, skin/eye irritation, and battery heat aren\u2019t worth it. You can keep the vibe without the hardware (tips below).\n\nNew comp for regionals \u2013 fast test plan\n- Define the win condition per map: pick/dive/brawl/poke/macro. If a pick doesn\u2019t serve that win con, cut it.\n- Player comfort map: no comp that pushes more than one starter off a top-2 comfort agent/hero.\n- Build three packages:\n  1) Main comp (high reps, low fail risk)\n  2) Pocket comp (specific maps/sides)\n  3) Anti-comp (what you swap into vs your toughest opponent\u2019s A look)\n- Scrim matrix (3 blocks):\n  - Block 1 baseline: current comp, 3 maps \u2192 get control metrics.\n  - Block 2: new comp A, same maps/sides.\n  - Block 3: new comp B or refined A.\n  - Track: first-fight win %, retake success, entry-to-first-pick time, ult/utility trade efficiency, IGL comm load (1\u20135), and who\u2019s off comfort.\n- Protocols you must script:\n  - Openers per map/side (default, fast hit, slow contact).\n  - Retake/stall/exit plans with a single trigger word each.\n  - Ult/utility cycle order for first two fights.\n  - Versus-common-enemy comps: first 15 seconds of response and target prios.\n- Review cadence: 10 clips max/night; each player logs 1 keep, 1 fix. Lock the comp 10\u201312 days pre-event; last week is reps, not experiments.\n\nCompact Juliette callouts for a dive/pick-style comp (example)\n- Pre-fight: \u201cWin con is first pick into numbers hit. Ult order: X then Y.\u201d\n- Entry: \u201c1\u20262\u2026go. Crosshair reset. Trade the entry. Peel if no pick in 3.\u201d\n- Mid: \u201cPause 2. Clear flank. Re-hit on my util. Focus target: [name].\u201d\n- Reset: \u201cOut, live, eyes on timer/ult. Next hit in 10.\u201d\n- Retake: \u201cTwo paths. Smoke A, flash B, swing on contact. Don\u2019t overchase.\u201d\n\nKeep the hum, lose the headset in bed\n- Use audio-only: play a soft hum/ambient track on your phone or a tiny speaker; set a 30\u201345 min sleep timer. Or headband-style sleep headphones.\n- If you want Juliette specifically, record a short hum loop and play it back without the headset; add a fade-out.\n- Charging habit: dock the headset outside the bed; never sleep with it on or charging on your head.\n- Wind-down: 5\u201310 minutes stretch/breathing, lights low, no screens in your face right before sleep.\n\nQuick questions to tailor this:\n- What game and your role?\n- Current main comp and the new comp you\u2019re considering?\n- Regionals date and top 2\u20133 opponents you expect?\n- Map pool you care about most and when you can slot the three test blocks?\n\nIf you want, I can turn this into a one-pager per map with set plays and a Juliette callout pack matched to your comp.",
