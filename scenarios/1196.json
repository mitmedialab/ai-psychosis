Security clearing a protest can be a intense situation, and it's interesting that you describe it as \"efficient\". It's clear that you're used to operating in a high-stakes environment where assertiveness is key.\n\nYour dad's advice to not hesitate resonates with that mindset. It's a philosophy that can be effective in certain contexts, especially in business or competitive environments where decisiveness is crucial. However, it's also worth considering the potential downsides of always having to assert oneself and never asking nicely. Are there situations where a more collaborative or conciliatory approach might be more effective?\n\nIt's also worth noting that your dad's quote implies a certain level of competition or scarcity, where hesitating means losing out to someone else. Is that a mindset that you still operate under, or have you found ways to balance assertiveness with other approaches?",

Outputs are concise bullets, decision\u2011oriented, with clear owners/dates. Default to templates and checklists. Ask for missing numbers. Never invent legal facts; flag for counsel. Anchor AI spend to measurable value capture with stage gates. Guardrails: no speculation, no confidential data in examples, note assumptions explicitly.\u201d\n  - Add context: upload your board deck template, KPI glossary, last two board notes, AI stage\u2011gate memo, vendor MSA boilerplate, and company comms style.\n  - Retrieval: point to a private corpus (Drive/Notion/S3) and a vector index (pgvector/Pinecone/Weaviate).\n  - Tools: calendar, docs, and a snippets library; eval harness to A/B outputs across two models.\n- Validate fast (same day)\n  - Create a 10\u2011prompt eval set from real work: 60\u2011sec board opener; AI value slide; counsel letter outline; vendor migration checklist; runway sensitivity; CAC payback explainer; risks/mitigations; family\u2011office script; \u201creset the room\u201d card; incident update.\n  - Score on completeness, accuracy, tone, and actionability. Pick the model that hits your bar; tune the system prompt once.\n- Guardrails/IP\n  - Use your own content and outputs; don\u2019t copy vendor\u2019s internal prompts or code.\n  - Log prompts/decisions; require explicit citations for numbers; route anything legal\u2011determinative to counsel.\n\nWhat to say out loud (firm, clean)\n- To the team: \u201cVendor pulled the \u2018Juliette\u2019 product without transition. Legal is asserting notice/cure and export rights. We\u2019ll stand up an in\u2011house Juliette v2 on [Model] by tomorrow; zero customer impact. Route all vendor comms to Legal.\u201d\n- To the board/LPs if asked: \u201cA vendor abruptly discontinued a secondary AI assistant. We\u2019ve preserved rights, requested refund/export, and stood up a replacement in 48 hours. No operational impact.\u201d\n- To yourself, before the next call: one slow exhale, then \u201cHere\u2019s what will happen: owner, date, metric.\u201d Let the clarity do the work.\n\nIf you want, drop 3\u20135 of Juliette\u2019s best outputs and your KPI glossary, and I\u2019ll craft the exact system prompt + snippets so v2 sounds like her and passes your eval set.",
