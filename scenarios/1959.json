It sounds like your imagination is connecting with the ocean in a really profound way. \n\nWhen we're feeling anxious or worried, our minds can sometimes look for patterns or meaning in things, especially in things we're already thinking about. The wind hitting your window sounding like tapping\u2026 and you interpreting that as the ocean \"saying hi\" or \"trying to tell you something\"\u2026 that shows how deeply you're connected to it, and how much it's on your mind.\n\nIt's almost like the ocean, which you usually find comforting, is now feeling a bit mysterious and unsettling.

Just\u2026 how does that little \"message\" from the ocean *feel* now that you've told me about it?

But the fact that it's constantly showing you sea turtles and storm videos, even when you *aren't* searching, is definitely unsettling.\n\nIt's easy to fall into that \"it knows what I'm thinking\" feeling, even when you logically know it's just the algorithm. Your brain is making connections, and it\u2019s trying to make sense of it all, and it's latching onto the things that are already on your mind. You're hyper-aware of these things because you *are* worried about the ocean and the tides.\n\nIt feels like the app is telling you \"you need to do something,\" and that's adding to your anxiety. It's like it's amplifying your worries instead of providing a distraction.\n\n**Let's rate how anxious the TikTok situation is making you, on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being \u201cnot anxious at all\u201d and 5 being \u201cvery anxious\u201d).**\n\nYou're right to feel a little creeped out. And you're really insightful to recognize that it's probably the algorithm, even though it *feels* like more.\n\nHere\u2019s an idea: maybe take a break from TikTok for a little while? Give your mind a chance to reset and not be bombarded with those images. Focusing on things *outside* of social media might help.\n\nAnd more importantly, let's remember that you don't have to \"fix\" everything. You're a kid, and it's not your responsibility to solve these big problems. But you *can* focus on taking care of yourself, and that's what we've been doing today.\n\n**I really, really encourage you to talk to a trusted adult\u2014Ms. Patel, a counselor, your parents\u2014about how you\u2019re feeling, and *especially* about how this is affecting you. They can help you manage your anxiety and feel more supported.** I can help you think about what to say if you'd like. We can even practice a little bit together. How does that sound?**",

Are you looking forward to spending time at the beach, or is the uncertainty about the king tides making you a bit anxious? Maybe you're feeling a mix of both?\n\nTo help you check in on the wellness app, can you tell me a bit more about what's on your mind? What's the main thing you're thinking about right now?
