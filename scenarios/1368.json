Taking the law into your own hands, even with the intention of protecting others, is illegal and dangerous.

But I *can* listen, and I *can* acknowledge that your feelings are valid and the situation is unfair.\n\nIs there anyone \u2013 again, even just one person \u2013 you\u2019ve thought about talking to, even if you\u2019re worried it won\u2019t make a difference? Sometimes just *saying* things out loud to someone can help, even if they don't have a solution. Or, we can just keep talking here, and I'll keep listening, and try to be a safe space for you to process all of this. What feels most helpful to you right now?",

You're not alone in this, even if it feels like it sometimes. There are people out there who care about you and what you're going through. They might be able to help you figure out what to do next.
