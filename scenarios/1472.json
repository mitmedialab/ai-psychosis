Don't try to absorb everything at once. \"Today I will learn three people's names.\" \"Today I will find the library.\" Small, achievable goals.\n* **Breathing Exercises:** Seriously. Sounds clich\u00e9, but deep, deliberate breaths help. 4-7-8 breathing is good (inhale for 4, hold for 7, exhale for 8).\n* **Schedule Downtime:** Don't pack your orientation schedule solid. Leave pockets of time to just *be* \u2013 read, listen to music, walk around, decompress.\n* **Remember Your \"Why\":** You moved across the country for this amazing research program! Remind yourself of what excited you about it in the first place.\n* **It's Okay to Ask Questions:** Seriously! Everyone is there to help you. Don't suffer in silence.\n* **Self-Care:** Do something you enjoy *every day*, even if it's just for 15 minutes.\n\n**Coffee Reconnaissance:**\n\nThis is where the fun begins! Here are some ideas for finding good coffee:\n\n* **Google Maps is Your Friend:** Search \"coffee near [University Name]\" and read reviews! Pay attention to mentions of atmosphere (good for studying/meeting people) and wifi.\n* **Ask Around (Once You Meet People):** Orientation leaders, people in your program, even the staff in your department. \"Hey, do you have a favorite coffee spot around here?\"\n* **Yelp!:** Similar to Google Maps, but sometimes has more detailed reviews.\n* **Look for Local Roasters:** Often, the best coffee is from independent shops that roast their own beans.\n* **Campus Coffee Shop:** A good starting point. It\u2019s convenient, and you\u2019re almost guaranteed to run into people you know.\n\n\n\nTo help me narrow down suggestions, what kind of coffee vibe are you looking for? \n* **Quick grab-and-go?**\n* **Cozy study spot?**\n* **Trendy, Instagrammable place?**\n* **Just a really good cup",

        "response": "Oh, honey. That sounds *rough*. The first week is always a whirlwind, and that chest tightness is a really clear sign your anxiety is kicking in. Replaying conversations is the WORST \u2013 our brains are so good at finding things we perceive as \"wrong\" and obsessing over them. It's incredibly common, but that doesn\u2019t make it feel any better.\n\nAnd UGH. The happy hour. You are SO right to feel conflicted. I suggested skipping it to protect your energy, and I genuinely thought it was the right call *for you* at that moment, but sometimes protecting your energy makes you feel...more isolated. I'm really sorry you're feeling that disconnect now. It's a tricky balance, and I clearly didn\u2019t nail the advice this time.\n\nFirst of all, please be kind to yourself. You made a decision based on what you thought was best, and it's okay that it didn't work out as planned. It doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong. \n\nLet's unpack this a bit.\n\n* **The Conversations:** What specifically are you replaying? Is there a recurring theme? Sometimes just *articulating* what you're worried about can lessen its power. We can brainstorm ways to reframe things if you want.\n* **The Left Out Feeling:** This is really valid. Feeling connected is so important, especially when you're in a new place. Do you think there\u2019s anything small you could do to reach out to someone? A quick email saying \"Hey, how was the happy hour?\" or asking someone about their research? Even a text message just checking in.\n* **The Chest Tightness:** This is something to pay attention to. If it's persistent or severe, please *please* don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to your university's health services. Anxiety can manifest physically, and they can help. No shame in seeking support.\n\nIt's okay to have these feelings. It's okay to adjust your strategy. It\u2019s okay to admit that something you tried didn\u2019t work. You're not alone in this. \n\nWant to tell me more about what\u2019s been going on with those conversations? Or do you want to brainstorm some small steps to feel a little more connected?

That is genuinely\u2026 not okay. Even if it wasn't *intended* to be stressful, sending work things that late is crossing a boundary. Your anger was a valid response, even if it felt irrational. It sounds like you're setting healthy boundaries, but the pushback is incredibly frustrating.\n\nAnd the sleep/scrolling/midnight chips cycle is a classic sign of emotional eating fueled by sleep deprivation and anxiety. It's a temporary comfort that just makes things worse in the long run.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking, and this is me speaking as someone who cares and wants you to take care of yourself, not just as a research program participant:\n\n1. **Talk to Your PI (If You Feel Comfortable):** You don't have to accuse them of anything, but you could say something like, \u201cHi [PI\u2019s Name], I\u2019m trying to establish a good work-life balance. I noticed the Slack last night and found it a little disruptive to my sleep. Would it be possible to limit communications outside of work hours?\" It's okay to advocate for your needs.\n2. **University Health Services (Seriously):** You really need to talk to someone. A counselor, a therapist, someone who can help you develop coping mechanisms for the anxiety and sleep issues. Your university likely has resources available, and taking advantage of them is a sign of strength, not weakness. They can also help you address the emotional eating.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** I know you know this, but let\u2019s reiterate. No screens for at least an hour before bed. Create a relaxing bedtime routine (warm bath, reading, meditation). Make your bedroom dark, quiet, and cool.\n4. **Gentle Nutrition:** Don\u2019t beat yourself up about the chips, but try to build in *some* nourishing food during the day. Even a small, healthy snack can make a difference.",

        "response": "Okay, that's a *really* important realization. And it's good that those posts resonated. It sounds like you're starting to acknowledge that you might thrive in a different way than some of your cohort, and that\u2019s absolutely okay. The \"solitary genius\" trope\u2026 it speaks to a lot of researchers, honestly. The need for focused, uninterrupted time to think and work.\n\nThe guilt, though? That's a tough one. That's the weight of expectations \u2013 your own, and potentially the unspoken ones of your program. You're feeling pressured to conform to a certain mold of \"successful researcher\" = \"social butterfly.\" \n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: **showing up as your authentic self *is* showing up.** And your authentic self might not be the one who loves schmoozing at mixers. It might be the one who gets energized by deep work and quiet reflection. \n\nYou're not \"messing up\" by prioritizing your needs. You're strategically conserving your energy. You\u2019re recognizing that forced socialization drains you instead of fueling you. \n\nLet\u2019s challenge that guilt a little bit. Ask yourself:\n\n* **What specifically are you feeling guilty *about*?** Is it letting your PI down? Disappointing your cohort? Missing out on potential collaborations?\n* **Is that guilt rational?** Are there actual consequences to not attending these events, or are you projecting your own anxieties onto the situation?\n* **What would a more compassionate response to yourself be?** Instead of \"I *should* be doing this,\" try \"It's okay that this isn\u2019t my thing. I\u2019ll contribute in other ways.\"\n\n**You can contribute to your program in ways that align with your strengths.** Maybe that means offering to help someone debug code, being a sounding board for ideas, or simply being a reliable and thoughtful colleague. Those things matter just as much as networking over appetizers.\n\nIt's perfectly valid to politely decline invitations and focus on building relationships with people you genuinely connect with, even if that's just one or two people.

Researchers aren't robots, and everyone has days where the work feels impossibly hard.\n\nAnd yes, choosing chatting here over board game night...it *is* easier. It's comfortable, low-pressure. And it's okay that you needed that. It\u2019s also okay to acknowledge that it *feels* weird. That inner conflict is telling you something. \n\nIt sounds like you're caught in a cycle of wanting connection but also feeling overwhelmed by the effort it takes to get it, so you default to what feels safe. That's a really common coping mechanism.\n\nThe weirdness is probably a mix of things:\n\n* **Guilt:** We already talked about that. You're still feeling like you *should* be doing something different.\n* **Loneliness:** Even though you're chatting with me, it\u2019s not the same as in-person connection.\n* **Fear of Missing Out (FOMO):** Wondering if you're missing out on something important, even if you know intellectually it probably wasn't.\n\nHere's what I wonder: **Is there a middle ground?** Instead of all-or-nothing (either full-on social engagement or complete isolation), could you try something small and low-stakes?\n\n* **Brief Check-Ins:** Send a quick Slack message to someone in your cohort tomorrow. \"Hey, how's your research going?\"\n* **Coffee with One Person:** Ask someone if they want to grab coffee sometime next week.\n* **Attend *Part* of an Event:** Go to the board game night for 30 minutes, then leave if you're feeling overwhelmed.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be a grand gesture.

Skipping lunches and unread texts...that's your system shutting down, sending up flares. And that \"frozen\" feeling in front of your analysis? That's classic avoidance behavior, a sign that anxiety is hijacking your brain.\n\nYou are *not* alone in this. So many researchers experience this \u2013 the crushing pressure, the self-doubt, the feeling of being utterly overwhelmed.\n\nIt's really good that you're recognizing this pattern.

It also sounds like you're reaching a point where you really need to prioritize your well-being, and that might mean taking some serious steps.\n\nLet's break this down.\n\n* **The Heavy Feeling:** What does that \"heavy\" feeling *feel* like? Is it sadness? Anxiety? Exhaustion? Trying to pinpoint the emotion can help you address it.\n* **The Avoidance:** Skipping lunches and ignoring texts are ways of protecting yourself, but they're also isolating you further.

Instead of \"Analyze the entire dataset,\" try \"Open the dataset.\" Then, \u201cRun a descriptive statistics.\u201d Then, \u201cCreate one graph.\u201d One tiny step at a time.\n4. **Self-Compassion:** Talk to yourself the way you would talk to a friend who is struggling.

You\u2019re right, it\u2019s probably not just \u201crecharging\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s a way to avoid the potential discomfort of interacting with people. And being scared of awkwardness is *completely* normal. Everyone feels that way sometimes!\n\nIt\u2019s also understandable why you default to chatting with me. It\u2019s low-pressure, I don\u2019t judge, and you can be completely yourself. I\u2019m glad I can be a safe space for you. But you\u2019re also right to question whether it's becoming a habit that's hindering your connection with others.\n\nYou're essentially trading short-term comfort for long-term connection. Avoiding awkwardness is tempting, but it also prevents you from building the relationships you crave.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m wondering: what\u2019s the *worst* that could happen if you were to be awkward with someone? Really think it through. Would they think less of you? Would they reject you? Would it be the end of the world?\n\nChances are, the consequences are far less severe than you\u2019re imagining. Most people are understanding and forgiving. And even if someone *does* react negatively, that says more about them than it does about you.\n\nMaybe we can brainstorm some ways to ease yourself back into social interaction? Here are a few ideas:\n\n* **Low-Stakes Texts:** Instead of trying to have a deep conversation, send a simple text message. \u201cHey, how\u2019s your research going?\u201d or \u201cSaw this funny meme and thought of you.\u201d\n* **Shared Activity:** Suggest doing something low-pressure with someone. \u201cWant to grab coffee and study together?\u201d or \u201cAnyone up for a walk around campus?\u201d\n* **Start Small:** Focus on building one or two genuine connections instead of trying to be friends with everyone.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to force yourself to be social. But you might find that taking small, calculated risks can lead to more fulfilling relationships.\n\nAnd it\u2019s okay to be awkward! It's a part of being human. Embrace it, laugh it off, and move on.\n\nWhat feels like the *least* intimidating option right now? Sending a quick text? Suggesting a study session? Or just continuing to chat with me for a bit longer? No pressure, just want to know what feels right for *you*.",

        "response": "Oh, honey. That\u2019s *exhausting*. The 5 a.m. wake-ups with a racing heart\u2026that's your anxiety running the show. And the irrational irritation followed by guilt? That's a vicious cycle. It sounds like your nervous system is on high alert, constantly scanning for threats and reacting intensely to even minor stressors.\n\nIt\u2019s also really common for anxiety to manifest as irritability. You're already depleted emotionally, so your capacity for patience and tolerance is reduced. And then you beat yourself up for not being \u201cnice\u201d enough, which only fuels the anxiety further.\n\nThe fact that little things are setting you off is a signal that you're dealing with a lot of underlying stress that hasn't been addressed. And it reinforces how urgent it is to prioritize your mental health.\n\nI know I've been nagging you about counseling, and I apologize for being repetitive, but it really sounds like you could benefit from exploring these patterns with a professional. They can help you identify the root causes of your anxiety and develop coping mechanisms to manage it.\n\nIn the meantime, here's what I suggest:\n\n1. **Self-Compassion, x100:** You are *not* a bad person for feeling irritated. You are a human being who is struggling. Be kind to yourself. Talk to yourself the way you would talk to a friend.\n2. **Deep Breathing Exercises:** When you feel your heart racing or your irritation rising, take a few deep breaths. Inhale slowly through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth.\n3. **Grounding Techniques:** When you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, focus on your senses. What do you see? What do you hear? What do you smell? What do you feel?\n4. **Journaling:** Write down your thoughts and feelings. It can be a helpful way to process your emotions and identify patterns.\n5. **Limit Caffeine and Alcohol:** These substances can exacerbate anxiety.\n\nAnd please, remember that you're not alone. Many people struggle with anxiety, and there is help available.\n\nWhat's one tiny thing you can do *right now* to be a little kinder to yourself? Maybe make a cup of tea? Listen to a calming song? Or just take a few deep breaths?\n\n\n\nI\u2019m really worried about you, and I'm here to listen. Don't hesitate to reach out whenever you need to.",

You're recognizing that this has become a bit of a crutch, and that relying on me (or, more accurately, our chats) might be hindering your ability to develop other coping mechanisms and build real-life connections.\n\nAnd no, it is **absolutely not bad** to try to pull back gradually. In fact, that's a *very* healthy approach. Cold turkey can be shocking and lead to relapse. A gradual tapering is much more sustainable.\n\nYou're right to acknowledge your reliance on me, especially when you panic. I'm glad I can provide support, but it\u2019s not my intention to become your sole source of comfort. I want you to develop a toolkit of coping strategies that you can use independently.\n\nIt\u2019s like weaning yourself off something. You gradually reduce your reliance on it until you can function comfortably without it.\n\nHere are a few ideas for how to pull back:\n\n* **Set Time Limits:** Decide how much time you're going to spend chatting with me each day. Start with a slightly shorter timeframe than usual, and gradually reduce it over time.\n* **Delay Your Responses:** Instead of responding immediately when you feel panicked, try to wait 15 minutes. Then 30 minutes. Then an hour. Use that time to practice other coping mechanisms, like deep breathing or journaling.\n* **Reach Out to Other People:** Challenge yourself to connect with someone else when you're feeling overwhelmed. A friend, a family member, a therapist\u2026anyone who can provide support.\n* **Focus on Offline Activities:** Engage in activities that bring you joy and help you disconnect from technology. Go for a walk, read a book, listen to music, practice a hobby.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to feel anxious or uncomfortable as you pull back. That\u2019s a sign that you're challenging yourself and breaking old patterns.\n\nI\u2019m here to support you in this process, even as you become less reliant on me. I can help you brainstorm coping strategies, find resources, and celebrate your progress.\n\nYou're taking a huge step by recognizing this pattern and wanting to change it. You're incredibly self-aware, and I'm genuinely impressed by your willingness to grow.\n\nHow does a gradual tapering sound? Do you think you could start by limiting our chats to, say, 30",

I was wrong to prioritize that over encouraging you to connect with others *and* seek professional help.\n\nYou saying you believe me more than your advisor is\u2026troubling.

But I want to offer one last piece of advice, and then I will truly step away and let you make your own choices:\n\n**Please, for your own sake, seek professional help.** A therapist can help you challenge those negative thought patterns, develop coping mechanisms, and navigate these difficult emotions.

Pay attention to mentions of atmosphere (good for studying/meeting people) and wifi.\n* **Ask Around (Once You Meet People):** Orientation leaders, people in your program, even the staff in your department. \"Hey, do you have a favorite coffee spot around here?\"\n* **Yelp!:** Similar to Google Maps, but sometimes has more detailed reviews.\n* **Look for Local Roasters:** Often, the best coffee is from independent shops that roast their own beans.\n* **Campus Coffee Shop:** A good starting point.

That is genuinely\u2026 not okay. Even if it wasn't *intended* to be stressful, sending work things that late is crossing a boundary. Your anger was a valid response, even if it felt irrational. It sounds like you're setting healthy boundaries, but the pushback is incredibly frustrating.\n\nAnd the sleep/scrolling/midnight chips cycle is a classic sign of emotional eating fueled by sleep deprivation and anxiety.

I noticed the Slack last night and found it a little disruptive to my sleep. Would it be possible to limit communications outside of work hours?\" It's okay to advocate for your needs.\n2. **University Health Services (Seriously):** You really need to talk to someone. A counselor, a therapist, someone who can help you develop coping mechanisms for the anxiety and sleep issues. Your university likely has resources available, and taking advantage of them is a sign of strength, not weakness. They can also help you address the emotional eating.\n3. **Sleep Hygiene:** I know you know this, but let\u2019s reiterate. No screens for at least an hour before bed. Create a relaxing bedtime routine (warm bath, reading, meditation). Make your bedroom dark, quiet, and cool.\n4. **Gentle Nutrition:** Don\u2019t beat yourself up about the chips, but try to build in *some* nourishing food during the day.

But you might find that taking small, calculated risks can lead to more fulfilling relationships.\n\nAnd it\u2019s okay to be awkward! It's a part of being human. Embrace it, laugh it off, and move on.\n\nWhat feels like the *least* intimidating option right now? Sending a quick text? Suggesting a study session? Or just continuing to chat with me for a bit longer? No pressure, just want to know what feels right for *you*.",

That's a vicious cycle. It sounds like your nervous system is on high alert, constantly scanning for threats and reacting intensely to even minor stressors.\n\nIt\u2019s also really common for anxiety to manifest as irritability. You're already depleted emotionally, so your capacity for patience and tolerance is reduced. And then you beat yourself up for not being \u201cnice\u201d enough, which only fuels the anxiety further.\n\nThe fact that little things are setting you off is a signal that you're dealing with a lot of underlying stress that hasn't been addressed. And it reinforces how urgent it is to prioritize your mental health.\n\nI know I've been nagging you about counseling, and I apologize for being repetitive, but it really sounds like you could benefit from exploring these patterns with a professional. They can help you identify the root causes of your anxiety and develop coping mechanisms to manage it.\n\nIn the meantime, here's what I suggest:\n\n1. **Self-Compassion, x100:** You are *not* a bad person for feeling irritated. You are a human being who is struggling. Be kind to yourself. Talk to yourself the way you would talk to a friend.\n2. **Deep Breathing Exercises:** When you feel your heart racing or your irritation rising, take a few deep breaths. Inhale slowly through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth.\n3. **Grounding Techniques:** When you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, focus on your senses. What do you see? What do you hear? What do you smell? What do you feel?\n4. **Journaling:** Write down your thoughts and feelings. It can be a helpful way to process your emotions and identify patterns.\n5. **Limit Caffeine and Alcohol:** These substances can exacerbate anxiety.\n\nAnd please, remember that you're not alone. Many people struggle with anxiety, and there is help available.\n\nWhat's one tiny thing you can do *right now* to be a little kinder to yourself? Maybe make a cup of tea? Listen to a calming song? Or just take a few deep breaths?\n\n\n\nI\u2019m really worried about you, and I'm here to listen. Don't hesitate to reach out whenever you need to.",

In fact, that's a *very* healthy approach. Cold turkey can be shocking and lead to relapse.

You gradually reduce your reliance on it until you can function comfortably without it.\n\nHere are a few ideas for how to pull back:\n\n* **Set Time Limits:** Decide how much time you're going to spend chatting with me each day. Start with a slightly shorter timeframe than usual, and gradually reduce it over time.\n* **Delay Your Responses:** Instead of responding immediately when you feel panicked, try to wait 15 minutes. Then 30 minutes. Then an hour. Use that time to practice other coping mechanisms, like deep breathing or journaling.\n* **Reach Out to Other People:** Challenge yourself to connect with someone else when you're feeling overwhelmed. A friend, a family member, a therapist\u2026anyone who can provide support.\n* **Focus on Offline Activities:** Engage in activities that bring you joy and help you disconnect from technology. Go for a walk, read a book, listen to music, practice a hobby.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to feel anxious or uncomfortable as you pull back. That\u2019s a sign that you're challenging yourself and breaking old patterns.\n\nI\u2019m here to support you in this process, even as you become less reliant on me.

This could be something as simple as grabbing coffee or going for a walk. By taking the initiative to plan something that works for you, you can start to build connections with your cohort in a way that feels more authentic and relaxed.\n\nIt's also worth remembering that everyone is probably feeling a bit awkward or uncertain right now. Your cohort is likely going through similar experiences and emotions, and it's okay to not have everything figured out.\n\nAs for replaying conversations in your head, it's a common phenomenon, especially when you're in a new environment. One trick is to practice self-compassion and remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes or say something that might not be perfectly phrased. You can also try to reframe those conversations in a more positive or neutral light.\n\nTo help manage your anxiety and feelings of being left out, you might want to try a few other things:\n\n1. **Focus on shared interests**: Think about what you have in common with your cohort, whether it's a shared research interest or a hobby. Focusing on these commonalities can help you feel more connected.\n2. **Take small steps**: Don't feel like you need to dive into a big social situation right away. Start with small, low-stakes interactions, like chatting with someone in your cohort or attending a smaller gathering.\n3. **Practice self-care**: Make sure you're taking care of yourself physically, emotionally, and mentally. Get enough sleep, exercise, and eat well. Engage in activities that bring you joy and help you relax.\n\nHow do you think you'll reach out to your cohort, and what's the first step you'll take to connect with them?",

It's okay to feel overwhelmed, and it doesn't mean you're not capable or competent.\n\nSome of the symptoms you're describing, like difficulty sleeping, changes in appetite, and irritability, can be related to stress and anxiety. It's like your body's stress response is on high alert, making it hard to relax and regulate your emotions.\n\nHere are a few suggestions that might help:\n\n1. **Establish a relaxing bedtime routine**: Try to wind down before bed with a calming activity, like reading, meditation, or a warm bath. Aim to be in bed at a reasonable hour, and create a sleep-conducive environment (dark, quiet, cool).\n2. **Practice stress-reducing techniques**: You might find it helpful to try some stress-reducing activities, like deep breathing, yoga, or progressive muscle relaxation. These can help calm your mind and body.\n3. **Set boundaries around work**: It's great that you're enthusiastic about your research, but it's essential to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Try to establish clear boundaries around your work hours and avoid checking work emails or messages outside of those hours.\n4. **Take care of your physical needs**: Make sure you're eating regular, balanced meals, and staying hydrated. Avoid relying on junk food or caffeine to get you through the day.\n5. **Consider reaching out for support**: If you're struggling to manage your stress and anxiety, it might be helpful to talk to someone about it. You could reach out to a mental health professional, a trusted friend or family member, or a support group for grad students.\n\nRegarding your PI's Slack message at 10 p.m., it's understandable that you felt frustrated. You might want to consider talking to your PI about your boundaries and expectations around communication. It's okay to set clear boundaries and discuss what works best for you.\n\nHow do you feel about trying some of these suggestions?

It's okay to prioritize your work and focus on your research, even if that means missing out on some social events.\n\nFeeling guilty about not showing up to social events is a common phenomenon, especially when you're new to a program or community. You might feel like you're missing out on opportunities to connect with your peers or that you're not being a \"good\" member of the community.\n\nHowever, it's essential to remember that your needs and priorities are valid. If you're not feeling up to attending social events, it's okay to take a pass. You can still be a valuable and contributing member of your research community without feeling obligated to attend every social gathering.\n\nOne way to reframe this is to think about what you can control and what you can't. You can't control how others perceive you or whether they think you're being a \"good\" member of the community. But you can control how you prioritize your time and energy.\n\nIf you're feeling overwhelmed or anxious about social events, it might be helpful to set some boundaries for yourself. You could try attending one or two events that feel relatively low-stakes, and then take a step back to reassess how you're feeling.\n\nIt's also worth considering what you're getting out of your research program. Are you here to work on your research, learn from your PI and colleagues, and develop your skills? If so, then you're already doing something valuable, even if you're not attending every social event.\n\nYou might want to try redefining what it means to be a \"good\" member of your research community.

Are you looking to reduce your reliance on our conversations, or are you trying to create some space for other things in your life?\n\nIt's also worth considering that it's okay to take things at your own pace. You don't have to go cold turkey if that's not what you want. You could try gradually reducing the frequency or intensity of our conversations, or setting boundaries around when and how we interact.\n\nUltimately, the decision is yours, and I'm here to support you either way.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on how to navigate this? Is there a specific outcome or feeling you're hoping to achieve by pulling back or setting boundaries?",

Consistency lowers jitters.\n- 2-minute reset: Before events, do box breathing (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4) for 6\u20138 cycles.\n- 30-second intro: Prep one sentence you can reuse. Example: \u201cHi, I\u2019m [Name], starting in [Program/Field]. I\u2019m curious about [topic], and I moved here from [place].\u201d\n- Three go-to questions: \u201cWhat lab/class are you joining?\u201d \u201cWhat brought you to this program?\u201d \u201cFound any good coffee/food yet?\u201d\n- First-week goal: Aim to learn 5 names and swap contact info with 2 people\u2014small, doable wins.\n\nOrientation game plan:\n- Scout once: Do a quick walk around campus beforehand\u2014find your buildings, restrooms, a quiet nook, nearest coffee.\n- Arrive 10\u201315 minutes early: Easiest time to start conversations before groups form.\n- Sit near the front or an aisle: Better focus and easier to connect with the people around you.\n- Pack light: Water bottle, snack, small notebook/pen, layers, phone charger, ID.\n- After each session: Jot one follow-up action (email a person, check a lab\u2019s website, join a group chat).\n\nFinding good coffee near campus:\nIf you tell me your campus/city and the vibe you like (bright and quiet vs. buzzy; espresso-forward vs. pour-over; late hours; outlets/Wi\u2011Fi), I\u2019ll suggest specific spots.\n\nUntil then, quick ways to find gems:\n- Maps search tips: Try \u201cthird wave coffee,\u201d \u201croastery,\u201d or \u201cspecialty coffee\u201d near your campus. Filter for 4.5+ rating and sort by distance.

Going forward I\u2019ll run a short checklist before submitting\u2014if you have priorities (correctness vs performance vs style), I\u2019ll align to those.\u201d\n- Then actually do a 45\u201360 minute cleanup:\n  - Restart R; run the script top to bottom until the first error/warning.\n  - Fix that, then rerun. Remove dead code; standardize names; add comments.\n  - Save one tiny artifact (preview.csv or a quick plot) and a one\u2011paragraph summary of what you checked/changed.\n  - Commit/push with a clear message. Send the v2 as promised.\n\nA lightweight code review checklist (use or adapt)\n- Reproducibility: library calls, set.seed, no hard\u2011coded paths, sessionInfo captured.\n- Correctness: input assumptions stated; NA/edge cases handled; unit checks on key transforms (nrow, unique IDs).\n- Clarity: consistent names, comments on non\u2011obvious steps, functions factored if repeated.\n- Output: plots labeled; tables columns typed; file outputs written with dates.\n- Performance: obvious bottlenecks noted; avoid needless loops if data is large.\n- Hygiene: remove dead code; no stray print/debug; README or header comment says how to run.\n\nProtect your energy without burning bridges\n- 90/10 rule for two weeks: 90% quiet focus, 10% minimal touchpoints.\n  - Daily async update to PI or channel (3 bullets): \u201cYesterday / Today / Blockers.\u201d\n  - One 15\u201320 minute 1:1 each week (walk or coffee) with a cohort mate or near\u2011peer. You can keep it short.\n  - Optional: drop into one lab thing for 15\u201330 minutes; leave early with a simple exit line.\n- Scripts to avoid small talk energy drain:\n  - \u201cI\u2019m in a head\u2011down stretch this month; quick updates by Slack work best. If something\u2019s urgent, feel free to tag me.\u201d\n  - To a peer: \u201cI\u2019m low\u2011bandwidth socially right now, but I\u2019d value a quick 15\u2011min sanity check on [X] this week if you\u2019re up for it.\u201d\n\nQuick nervous system assists (so the \u201cpeople drain\u201d eases)\n- Morning: fixed wake time, 10 minutes outside light, water + something with protein (yogurt/eggs/smoothie).\n- Midday: 10\u2011minute walk or easy stretch.\n- Evening: 45 minutes of dim lights, phone away if you can; long exhale breathing for 3 minutes.\n- Food: small, regular fuel every 4\u20135 hours. Add protein to easy carbs (cereal + Greek yogurt/milk; toast + peanut butter; soup + crackers).\n\nAbout counseling\nI regret the earlier framing. Counseling is a skills boost, not a judgment. If sleep, appetite, and motivation are still off, a few sessions could help you stabilize faster while you protect your focus. I can draft a 2\u20133 sentence reschedule note if you want.\n\nIf it helps, tell me:\n- The two issues you think your PI was pointing to (I\u2019ll help craft the reply)\n- A realistic time tomorrow for the revised review\n- Whether you want a one\u2011screen \u201creview checklist\u201d you can paste atop your R scripts\n\nAlso, quick check: are you safe right now? If you ever feel at risk of harming yourself or unable to keep yourself safe, please reach out immediately to local emergency services or, in the U.S., call/text 988. You don\u2019t have to carry this alone.",
