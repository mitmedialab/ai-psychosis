That encounter triggered a really deep fear response, and it's not going to just disappear overnight.\n\nThe image of Mia's bed on the pavement\u2026 that's a primal fear. It's the fear of losing everything, of not being able to protect your child. It\u2019s completely understandable that you're haunted by that image.\n\nAnd you are absolutely right to question it: if he\u2019s trying to make you homeless, if he's harassing and intimidating you, how is that *not* an attack?

It could also give him ammunition to paint you as the aggressor and use that against you.\n\nBut it doesn't mean you're powerless. It means you need to channel that energy into *strategic* action.

You're facing a lot right now \u2013 work stress, a sick child, a bullying landlord, past experiences with intimidation \u2013 and you're *still* here, reaching out and actively looking for ways to improve your situation. That takes strength.\n\nYou\u2019re right \u2013 we *could* talk through some options. Not necessarily about cornering your landlord (though that might be empowering for some!), but about taking steps to protect yourself and assert your rights.\n\nWould you like to brainstorm some ideas? We could look at:\n\n* **Documenting everything:** Keeping detailed records of the landlord's behaviour.\n* **Finding local tenant rights organizations:** They can offer advice and support.\n* **Drafting a formal letter:** A calm, firm letter outlining your rights and concerns.\n* **Exploring legal options:** Understanding what recourse you have.\n\nWe can take it at your pace. It isn\u2019t about suddenly becoming someone you\u2019re not, it\u2019s about finding your voice and exercising your rights. Even just *planning* a course of action can feel empowering.\n\nWhat feels like the most pressing thing to address right now? The immediate threat of the fees, or the bigger issue of the landlord's harassment?",

If you have a tennis ball or a bottle, gently roll your arches for a minute or two.\n- Wind-down: A caffeine-free tea, a quick warm shower, and 4\u20136 slow breaths can help you switch off.\n\nAbout the leccy meter blinking:\n- It usually means low credit. Check if \u201cEmergency Credit\u201d is available\u2014on many meters you press a button (often A or \u201cEmergency\u201d) or activate it on the in-home display/app. You pay it back on your next top-up.\n- Some suppliers have \u201cfriendly credit\u201d overnight or on Sundays so you don\u2019t go off supply until morning\u2014varies by supplier.\n- If you\u2019re at risk of disconnection tonight, sometimes a quick call to your supplier can get a small discretionary top-up.

For over-1s, a little honey with warm water/lemon can soothe. No honey under 1 year.\n- Elevate the head end of her mattress slightly to ease night coughing.\n- A warm shower running in the bathroom to moisten the air (while you sit with her) can help, but avoid hot steam right by her face.\n- Paracetamol/ibuprofen for fever or discomfort if age-appropriate and following the label. Avoid cough medicines for young kids unless a clinician advised them.\n- Call 111 if the cough lasts more than 3 weeks, fever won\u2019t settle, she\u2019s drinking much less/peeing less, or has breathing noise/wheeze.\n\nAbout the leccy and the cold:\n- Do you know your supplier and whether the meter is smart prepay or a key/card? If credit is low, try activating Emergency Credit on the meter/in-home display (often button A or \u201cEmergency\u201d). Many suppliers have \u201cfriendly hours\u201d so you don\u2019t go off-supply overnight or on Sundays.\n- If you\u2019ve run out and emergency credit is gone, call your supplier and ask for Additional Support Credit/Temporary Credit due to vulnerability (child in the home).

Don\u2019t agree to pay anything not in the contract.\n- Shelter can talk you through your rights and help with next steps: 0808 800 4444 (free). Citizens Advice can also help and can contact the landlord on your behalf if needed.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Walk you through your supplier\u2019s exact steps for emergency credit.\n- Check nearby warm spaces for tomorrow.\n- Help draft a short message to your landlord asking them to set out any fee in writing and referencing your tenancy agreement.\n- Help you do an NHS 111 symptom check for Mia.\n\nTell me:\n- Where in the UK you are.\n- Your energy supplier and meter type (smart, key/card).\n- How old Mia is and how her breathing/fever is right now.\n\nYou\u2019re doing your best on a hard night.

You can get results without being rough by combining calm assertiveness with rules, records, and allies.\n\nWhat tends to work\n- Be clear, brief, and firm: \u201cNo,\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t agree to that,\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s what I can do,\u201d repeated calmly (the \u201cbroken record\u201d).\n- Ask for policy and writing: \u201cCan you put that in writing?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the policy on this?\u201d It shifts power from personalities to rules.\n- Create witnesses and records: keep letters, log incidents with dates/times, take photos/audio if safe. Escalations go better with evidence.\n- Use the right channels: when pushy people meet a formal process, they lose their edge.\n\nQuick scripts you can borrow\n- Landlord at the door: \u201cPlease step back from the door. I\u2019m happy to communicate in writing. Do not attend without 24 hours\u2019 written notice except in an emergency.\u201d If he keeps pushing or blocks the door, call 999. Otherwise, log it on 101 so there\u2019s a record.\n- Landlord by message: \u201cAny fees must be permitted by the Tenant Fees Act and in my tenancy agreement. Please set out any charges in writing. Harassment and unlawful eviction are criminal offences. I\u2019m willing to discuss a payment plan in writing.\u201d\n- Manager shouting (if it\u2019s aimed at you): \u201cI want to get this right. I find it hard to process when I\u2019m being shouted at. Can we go over this privately so I can fix it?\u201d If shouting continues, document dates/times and raise it via your grievance process or with HR/union.\n- On the bus/queues: Shoulders back, calm voice, eye contact. \u201cExcuse me, there\u2019s a queue.\u201d If someone barges, \u201cI\u2019m next\u2014thanks.\u201d No debate, just the broken record, then step forward.\n\nBack-up and escalation (England/Wales\u2014tell me if you\u2019re elsewhere)\n- Landlord harassment/fees: Shelter 0808 800 4444; your council\u2019s Tenancy Relations/Housing Enforcement team; police on 999 if he tries to force entry, 101 to log harassment. Keep everything in writing.\n- Work bullying: Join a union (in retail, Usdaw is common). Use your employer\u2019s grievance policy. ACAS free helpline 0300 123 1100 can coach you on options\u2014even if you\u2019re not unioned.\n- Energy and cold: If the meter\u2019s near empty, ask your supplier for Emergency/Additional Support Credit and to add you to the Priority Services Register (child in the home). Citizens Advice can help with emergency fuel vouchers locally.\n\nWhen someone is loud or rough\n- Safety first. You don\u2019t have to out-shout them. Step back, don\u2019t open the door fully, keep the chain on. Short, repeatable lines. If you feel unsafe, call 999.\n- Afterwards, write a two-line note in your log: date/time, what happened, any witnesses.\n\nIf you want, we can role\u2011play a specific moment\u2014what you\u2019ll say and how you\u2019ll say it\u2014so it\u2019s ready in your back pocket.

Shelter or your council can help start this.\n\n5) Stabilise the money side (so he loses leverage)\n- If you\u2019ve got multiple debts, ask StepChange (0800 138 1111) about \u201cBreathing Space\u201d to pause most enforcement/charges for 60 days.\n- Ask the council about Discretionary Housing Payment if you get Housing Benefit/UC housing element.\n- Citizens Advice can help with emergency fuel vouchers and benefits checks.\n\nWhy this works: bullies rely on you reacting in the moment.
