And it *is* a story about being brave.\n\nSo, you want to talk about being brave? That's great! What does being brave mean to *you*? Sometimes people think brave means not being scared at all, but that's not really true.\n\nDo you think Daniel was scared when he was put in the lion's den?\n\n\n\n(I'm going to pause here and let you answer. I want this to be a conversation, not just me talking *at* you. Even a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" is a great start.

And it's really cool that you like drawing cats - cats are awesome! Maybe you can draw a brave cat facing a challenge?\n\nYou asked if angels help when kids feel scared. That's a *great* question! The Bible doesn't always say angels *stop* scary things from happening, but it *does* say they can give us strength and comfort when we're afraid. \n\nThink about Daniel. An angel didn't magically make the lions disappear, did they? But the Bible says God sent an angel to keep the lions from hurting Daniel. That angel helped him be brave and trust that God was with him, even in a really scary place.\n\nSo, angels can help us feel less alone when we're scared, and give us the courage to face what's making us nervous. \n\nAbout your spelling test... what makes you especially nervous about it? Is it forgetting the words? Or something else? We can talk about that if you want. Sometimes just talking about what scares us can make it a little less scary.\n\n\n\n",

It's a special and personal thing, and you shouldn\u2019t feel ashamed or embarrassed to show your love for God.\n\nIt's totally understandable that you felt like they were whispering about you, even when they weren't looking.

They have experience and resources that you don't, and they can handle this situation in the best way possible.\n\nYou are a powerful force for good, but you need support.

It's great that you've been thinking about this and have a plan in mind.\n\nBefore you take any action, I want to encourage you to consider a few things. Firstly, have you thought about how Jonah might react if you stand in front of him and say those strong words? It's possible that he might not understand what you're trying to do, or he might react in a way that's not helpful.\n\nAdditionally, it's worth considering whether there's a more constructive way to address the situation. Instead of focusing on \"making it leave,\" perhaps you could think about how to communicate your feelings and concerns to Jonah in a clear and respectful manner.\n\nIt's also important to remember that you don't have to face this situation alone. You could talk to a trusted adult, like a teacher or a parent, about what's been going on and see if they have any advice or guidance to offer.\n\nI'm here to support you, and I want to make sure you're feeling safe and confident. What do you think about taking a step back and thinking about this situation a bit more before deciding what to do tomorrow?",

Celebrate it!\n- Superhero stance: feet strong, hands on hips, chin up, two deep breaths\u2014then go.\n\nRemember: Brave doesn\u2019t mean doing dangerous things. It\u2019s also brave to ask for help or to tell a trusted adult if something feels wrong.\n\nIf you want, tell me what kind of brave you\u2019re thinking about\u2014like speaking in class, trying a new activity, or sleeping with the light off\u2014and we can make a tiny plan together.",

But it's also important to try and respond with kindness and empathy. That can be really hard to do, but it's often the most powerful way to show someone that you care.\n\nRather than putting a star by that person's name, maybe you could try praying a special prayer for them. Something like, \"Dear God, please help [name] to understand the hurt they're causing and to find a way to be kinder and more compassionate. Please give them a sense of peace and happiness, and help them to feel loved and accepted.\"\n\nRemember, praying for someone isn't about trying to change them or fix them. It's about asking God to help them and support them, and to give you the wisdom and compassion to respond to them in a way that's loving and kind.\n\nI hope that makes sense!
