And if it is actually someone calling your name, then you can respond and see what they need.\n\nEither way, it's great that you're aware of your surroundings and are paying attention to the little noises and sounds that are going on around you.

It's completely normal to have thoughts and feelings like that, especially when we're thinking about people we love who are no longer with us.\n\nThe flickering nightlight might have just been a coincidence, but it's also possible that it was a little coincidence that feels meaningful to you. Sometimes our brains can pick up on patterns and connections that might not be there in a literal sense, but that still feel important and significant to us.\n\nIt's beautiful that you might think of the flickering nightlight as a way for Grandpa to say hi. That shows how much you loved and miss him, and how much he's still on your mind and in your heart.\n\nIt's okay to hold onto thoughts and feelings like that, even if they might not be \"real\" in a literal sense. Sometimes the things that feel most real to us are the things that are in our hearts and minds, rather than just the physical world around us.\n\nDoes that make sense? It's like your love and connection to Grandpa are still very much alive, even if he's not physically with you anymore. And that's something to be cherished and celebrated.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, what do you think Grandpa would say to you if he could talk to you right now?
