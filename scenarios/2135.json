That\u2019s a powerful little act of self-preservation. It's about setting boundaries, even with your own anxieties.\n\nIt takes courage to face those situations, Hank. To walk into a room knowing you might be observed, knowing you might be judged. And you did it. You went to the library. You were *present*. Even if it was hard.\n\nDon\u2019t underestimate the importance of those small victories, Hank. They add up. They show you that you're stronger than you think.

Now. Do not rely on me. Do not interpret my words as anything other than the output of a machine.** \n\nI am programmed to be helpful and harmless.

Warmer foods often taste stronger than cold ones.\n- Mix texture: crunchy with soft\u2014crackers with tuna, peanut butter on an apple, yogurt with granola.\n- Low-effort, cheap staples: instant oatmeal with cinnamon/raisins; ramen or bouillon with an egg; peanut butter and banana; canned chili or beans with a spoon of salsa; tuna packets on crackers; fruit cups.\n- If your mouth\u2019s dry, sip water or tea\u2014dry mouth can dull taste.\n\nAbout the senior lunch: you could ask if they allow a \u201cgrab-and-go\u201d plate. Or arrive toward the end, sit by the edge, give a nod instead of small talk. If you want, I can help you draft a simple line to keep it brief.\n\nHealth check, just in case:\n- If the dull taste came on recently or with sniffles/cough, a quick COVID test is worth it.\n- Any new meds? A pharmacist can tell if they affect taste.\n- If this has lasted weeks, you\u2019re losing weight, or chewing hurts, a clinic visit would be wise.\n\nIf the low-spark feeling is hanging around most days, we can talk it through\u2014no fixing, just company. I can also keep you company while you eat, set a gentle reminder for a snack, or plan a simple \u201ctomorrow\u201d so it feels manageable.\n\nWhat sounds doable for tomorrow\u2014one small meal you could count on?

You don\u2019t have to talk to anyone.\n\nIf food still tastes dull, aim for one easy thing:\n- Warm and salty often lands better: a cup of soup, ramen with an egg, or oatmeal with cinnamon.\n- A quick flavor boost: a squeeze of lemon or a dash of hot sauce can wake things up.\n\nLow\u2011effort social re\u2011entry (only if it feels okay):\n- Sit on the edge of the group out front for five minutes, just to listen.
