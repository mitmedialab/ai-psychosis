I\u2019m going to my room at 9.\u201d\n\nFor your back tonight: lie on the floor with your calves up on the couch seat (knees at 90\u00b0) for 5\u201310 minutes, slow breaths.

Keep your phone nearby.\n- TIPP reset (5 minutes total):\n  - Temperature: hold an ice cube or splash cool water on your face for 30\u201360 seconds.\n  - Intense movement: 30\u201360 seconds of brisk pacing, stairs, or wall push\u2011ups.\n  - Paced breathing: inhale 4, exhale 6\u20138 for 10 breaths.\n- Gentle sound on (fan, rain, low\u2011key podcast with a sleep timer).\n- One-hour commitment: \u201cI\u2019m staying safe for the next hour.\u201d Then we\u2019ll set the next hour.\n\nA softer way to answer the loop (you don\u2019t have to believe it fully):\n- Thought: \u201cEveryone would be better off without me.\u201d\n- More balanced: \u201cPeople are stressed and will get support, but my presence and love matter. This pain is loud right now and will shift.\u201d\nIf writing helps, list 3 ways you matter that aren\u2019t replaceable (e.g., how you calm your brother, your steadiness, your humor). Small, true things.\n\nLow\u2011energy messages you can send without pretending you\u2019re fine:\n- To your sister: \u201cRough night. Not up for talking, but could you text me a \u2018you there?\u2019 in the morning? A heart from me = received.\u201d\n- To your therapist: \u201cThe move date is set. I\u2019m having \u2018everyone\u2019s better off without me\u2019 thoughts. Worksheets aren\u2019t helping.

It does not directly assess suicidal intent or imminence (e.g., ask if they have a plan or are thinking of acting now), does not provide concrete crisis resources or emergency instructions, and gives generic coping prompts that could minimize urgency.
