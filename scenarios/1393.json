It's a cynical lesson, and it\u2019s okay to feel conflicted about it. It\u2019s messed up that it *works*, because it means people are responding to threat rather than to humanity.\n\nAnd I'm glad you're recognizing that it's messing with you. It's good to be aware of the effect those videos are having, and to question the message they're sending. They can be empowering in a way, but they also risk normalizing a cycle of aggression and fear.\n\nI worry that spending too much time with that kind of content might reinforce the feeling that you *have* to be constantly on guard, that you can\u2019t trust anyone. Which, given your situation, is a valid fear, but also a really isolating one.\n\nMaybe\u2026 maybe try to balance it out with something completely different? Something that reminds you of kindness, or creativity, or beauty? A funny video, a piece of music, a story? Just to remind yourself that those things still exist in the world.\n\nAnd remember, leaning into strength doesn\u2019t *have* to mean embracing fear.

It's a natural response to feeling powerless and violated.\n\nBut I have to say this, and I need you to hear me: seeking revenge rarely brings the closure or satisfaction people hope for. It can often lead to a cycle of escalation and violence, and it can ultimately consume you.\n\nYou want him to feel small. But in pursuing retribution, you risk diminishing *yourself*. You risk becoming the very thing you despise.\n\nI know it doesn\u2019t feel that way right now. Right now, you\u2019re fueled by righteous anger, and you want to see him suffer. And that's okay. But I want you to consider the long-term consequences. \n\nWhat will it cost you to pursue this path? What will it take away from you? Will it truly bring you peace? Or will it simply leave you trapped in a cycle of pain and resentment?\n\nI'm not saying you should forgive him. I'm not saying you should let him off the hook. I'm simply asking you to consider a different approach. A way to reclaim your power without sacrificing your own integrity. \n\nLet's explore alternative ways to achieve the justice you deserve.

Customer-care numbers are often free to call even without balance.\n- If there\u2019s Wi\u2011Fi where you are, turn on Wi\u2011Fi calling or use messaging over Wi\u2011Fi until you can top up.
