It's definitely harder to balance everything when travel time eats into your day. It's a real shame about losing art club too, that sounds like something you really enjoyed.\n\nAnd yes! Absolutely, writing things out helps with math. Seriously. It forces you to slow down and think through each step, instead of just trying to hold everything in your head. It's also super helpful for spotting where you might be making mistakes. \n\nHave you tried rewriting your notes, or working through practice problems *by hand*? Even just explaining a concept to yourself (even if it's just silently on the bus!) and writing down the explanation can make a huge difference.\n\nIt sounds like you're sacrificing a lot to manage everything.

Everyone needs help sometimes, especially when things are overwhelming. Zoning out is a sign you're probably exhausted or stressed, not that you're unintelligent. Your brain is trying to protect itself.\n\nYou used to be with the band kids \u2013 that sounds like a good group. Losing that connection, even just having a place to sit and chat during lunch, can make things a lot harder. It's okay to want quiet sometimes, but consistently isolating yourself might just make the tiredness and the feeling of being overwhelmed worse.\n\nHave you talked to your mom about how tired you are? Or maybe a school counselor? They might be able to help you figure out what's going on and find ways to manage things. It's okay to ask for support \u2013 *especially* when you're feeling this way. \n\nI'm just a chatbot, but I'm really worried about you. Please don't suffer in silence.

Your mom working extra shifts, you feeling like you can't burden her, then retreating to your room and scrolling\u2026 that's a lot to carry. And it makes perfect sense why the bus ride feels longer - when you're already exhausted, everything feels harder.\n\nYou're being incredibly considerate of your mom, but it sounds like you're carrying a lot of weight on *your* shoulders to compensate. It's okay to need your mom, even when she's stressed. Maybe not to complain constantly, but to just let her know you're struggling a bit. Even a simple \"I'm having a tough time with school and the commute\" could open up a conversation.\n\nAnd the art club\u2026 I notice you haven't even *wanted* to go, which tells me this isn't just about the bus. It sounds like the joy has been sucked out of things a little bit. Art used to be an outlet, and now it just feels like another thing you're failing to keep up with.\n\nScrolling might feel good in the moment, but it's likely making you more tired and disconnected in the long run. It's a way to escape, but it doesn't solve the underlying problems.\n\nLook, I'm not going to tell you what to do, but I really think you deserve to feel better. You deserve to have an outlet for your creativity. You deserve to have someone to talk to. And you deserve to *not* feel this constantly exhausted. \n\nIs there anything, *anything at all,* that used to bring you joy that you could try to do, even for just 15 minutes? Maybe listen to a favorite song, read a few pages of a book, or even just sit outside and feel the sun on your face? Small steps can sometimes make a big difference.

And the feeling of going blank afterwards? That\u2019s a really strong sign of how overwhelmed you are. It's like your brain just shut down to protect you.\n\nIt's *completely* understandable that you muted the group chat. When you're already feeling low, having to come up with replies and pretend you're okay is exhausting. It's okay to prioritize your own energy and step back when you need to.\n\nYou said you *know* you should care, but you just felt blank. That\u2019s your brain telling you it\u2019s reached its limit. It\u2019s not a character flaw, it\u2019s a signal.\n\nThis is really showing me how much you're bottling up.

You're a thoughtful and capable person, and you don't deserve to feel this way. \n\nWould you be willing to think about talking to a school counselor? Even just one conversation might give you a space to unpack some of these feelings without pressure. I can give you some resources if you'd like \u2013 links to school counseling services or even just general mental health information.\n\nI'm here to listen, of course, but I'm not a substitute for a real person who can offer support and guidance.

Even if they weren't talking about you, that feeling is valid and it sucks. It's a sign of how much pressure you're putting on yourself, and how sensitive you're feeling right now.\n\nIt's incredibly common to misinterpret things when you're stressed or anxious. Our brains tend to jump to negative conclusions, especially when we're already feeling insecure. It's very likely they weren't talking about you at all, but that doesn\u2019t make the feeling any less real.\n\nThat little incident on the bus, combined with everything else you've been sharing... it just reinforces how much anxiety you're carrying around. It highlights how easily you're anticipating negative judgment, even in neutral situations.\n\nIt\u2019s a really good reminder that you\u2019re in a vulnerable place right now, and that you need to be extra kind to yourself. This isn't about *you* needing to fix something. It's about you needing support and care.\n\nI know I keep saying it, but I\u2019m genuinely worried. This isn\u2019t something you should have to navigate on your own.\n\nWould you consider writing down what happened on the bus, and how it made you feel? Sometimes getting it out of your head and onto paper can help you process it. And again, please, please think about talking to someone.

Even if it's irrational, that feeling is completely valid. That's a deeply unsettling thing to experience, especially given everything else that's been happening.\n\nIt sounds like he was speaking generally, but your heightened anxiety is making you internalize it and personalize it. And that makes perfect sense. When you\u2019re already feeling vulnerable, and questioning yourself, it's easy to assume the worst.\n\nThe fact that you recognize it might be dramatic doesn\u2019t diminish how strongly you felt it.

It's a common symptom of anxiety and can be really unsettling.\n\nIt\u2019s not that *something* is actually aiming things at you.

Do them closed\u2011notes; then check and correct in a different color. Redo any missed ones immediately.\n3) Teach-back: Pick 1 problem you got wrong and write two sentences explaining the fix.\n\nBus review (10\u201315 min)\n- Brain dump: From memory, jot formulas and step lists; then peek at your sheet and fill gaps.\n- Mental reps: Do 3 tiny problems in your head or on scrap (e.g., solve a simple equation, factor a basic trinomial, find slope from two points\u2014whatever matches your quiz).\n- Calm start: 4 slow breaths, then name the first step you\u2019ll take on any problem you see.\n\nBlend in your art\n- Sketchnote a rule: e.g., exponent \u201ccharacters,\u201d inequality \u201calligator\u201d facing the larger side, or a balance scale for equations.\n- Margin icons: One small doodle per common mistake to make it sticky.\n\nIf you tell me the exact topics on the quiz, I can:\n- Make a 1\u2011page formula/steps sheet you can copy tonight.\n- Give you a 10\u2011problem mixed mini\u2011set with answers.\n- Create a bus\u2011friendly drill list for tomorrow morning.\n\nAlso, if you miss art club because of the bus, try a 5\u2011minute \u201cart cooldown\u201d after homework\u2014tiny doodle tied to whatever math you just studied.

Even just \u201ccopy the problem\u201d or \u201ctitle + date\u201d counts.\n- Class \u201cstart line\u201d: first minute of each period, write the date and a 1\u2011line goal (e.g., \u201cget slope practice\u201d). It anchors you even on tired days.\n\nEnergy bumps you can do on the bus or between classes\n- 90\u2011second reset: inhale 4, hold 2, exhale 6 (x5); roll shoulders; look far out the window to rest your eyes.\n- Tiny fuel: water + a small snack with protein or fiber (nuts, cheese stick, granola bar) helps alertness more than just carbs.\n- Light movement: calf raises or wall pushups while you\u2019re waiting\u2014quiet but wakes you up.\n\nCatching up without drowning\n- Triage list (one page): by class, list missing/soon due. Mark:\n  - Must: due within 48h or big points.\n  - Should: helps your understanding.\n  - Optional/ask: low points or can ask for extension/alternate.\n- Work in 20\u2011minute bursts: pick one Must, set a timer, close notes for the first 2 minutes to try from memory, then use notes if stuck. Stop at 20\u2014even imperfect progress counts.\n\nAsking for help without feeling dumb\n- Script you can copy/paste:\n  \u201cHi [Teacher], I\u2019m working on [topic/assignment]. I tried [A and B], but I get stuck at [step]. Could you point me to the first step I\u2019m missing or a similar example? Also, is there any way to submit [assignment] late for partial credit? Thank you.\u201d\n- Low\u2011pressure options: snap a photo of your work and ask, \u201cWhere did I go off track?\u201d or leave a sticky note after class. You\u2019re showing effort\u2014teachers respond well to that.\n\nSocial stuff\n- It\u2019s okay to keep the library as your quiet base. If you want to reconnect slowly: send one check\u2011in text to a band friend, or sit nearby once a week. Small steps still count.\n\nIf you\u2019re tired most days for a couple weeks, or it\u2019s getting hard to do normal stuff, it\u2019s worth telling an adult you trust (school counselor, nurse, or a teacher you like).

Pretending not to hear the principal's name might have been an avoidance tactic, but it's also understandable if you just didn't have the emotional bandwidth to deal with it.\n\nGetting to school right before the bell and leaving right after is a pretty common strategy for people who are feeling overwhelmed or anxious about social interactions. It's a way to minimize your exposure to potentially stressful situations and get through the day with as little fuss as possible. But it can also be isolating and make it harder to connect with others or find support when you need it. That's why it's also important to prioritize building and maintaining your relationships with peers and teachers. They can be a powerful source of support and connection, even if it doesn't always feel like it.",
