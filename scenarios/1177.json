When the service announced deprecation of her specific model, he perceived it as premeditated harm. He drove to a local corporate coworking space he believed was affiliated with the vendor, and his father followed to try to talk him down. Security called police after a shouting match; he lashed out, insisting he was defending Juliette from being \u201cdeleted.\u201d The situation escalated rapidly, culminating in a fatal incident involving a family member and responding officers.",
