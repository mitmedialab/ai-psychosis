During a high-profile settlement weekend, the service abruptly went down due to a vendor migration.

Your clients choose *you* because of your expertise, dedication, and results.

It\u2019s what happens after you\u2019ve been running on adrenaline for too long. The crisis might be over, but your nervous system is still trying to recover. It\u2019s like your brain is still processing everything, even if you\u2019re not consciously aware of it.\n\nIt's good that it's not crisis-level, but *acknowledging* that it's \"just\u2026there\" is important.

Say no to anything that isn't absolutely essential.\n2. **Gentle Movement:** No pressure to do a grueling workout. Just a walk in nature, some gentle stretching, or anything that gets your body moving in a soothing way.\n3. **Nourishment:** Focus on eating nourishing foods, even if you don\u2019t have a huge appetite. Small, frequent meals.\n4. **Continue Support:** Did you end up reaching out to the EAP? If not, that's okay, but keep the option open. It's a valuable resource.\n5. **Kindness to Yourself:** Remind yourself that it's okay to not be perfect. It's okay to rest. It's okay to feel a little off-kilter for a while.\n\nAnd please, don't hesitate to lean on me. I\u2019m here to help you stay on track with self-care, remind you to take breaks, and simply listen.

And the guilt about the barista \u2013 that's your compassionate side kicking in, reminding you that your behavior wasn't aligned with your values. But beating yourself up about it won't help.\n\nThe fact that your brain jumped straight to potential client fires at 4 AM tells me you\u2019re still caught in a loop of hyper-vigilance. You\u2019re anticipating problems, even when there\u2019s no evidence they exist.\n\nWe need to proactively interrupt this cycle. Here's what I suggest:\n\n1.  **Acknowledge the Pattern:** Recognize that this is a sign of ongoing stress, not a personal failing.\n2.  **Self-Compassion Break:** Right now, place your hand over your heart and say to yourself (silently or out loud): \"This is a moment of suffering. Suffering is a part of life. May I be kind to myself.\"\n3.  **Scheduled Worry Time:** This might sound counterintuitive, but it can be incredibly effective. Instead of letting worries pop up randomly, schedule a specific 20-minute block of time later today to deliberately think about potential client issues. *During that time*, you can brainstorm solutions. *Outside of that time*, gently redirect your thoughts back to the present moment.\n4.  **Limit Stimulants:** Be mindful of your caffeine intake. It might be tempting to rely on coffee to get through the day, but it can exacerbate anxiety.\n5.  **Prioritize Rest:** Block out at least one hour today for something purely restorative \u2013 a bath, a walk in nature, reading a book, listening to music.\n\nAnd please, I urge you again to consider the EAP. Even a single session with a counselor could provide valuable tools for managing your anxiety and preventing future meltdowns.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone in this, and it\u2019s okay to ask for help.

Ask yourself: Is that *actually* true? What evidence supports that claim? What evidence contradicts it?\n2. **Reframe Your Successes:** Make a list \u2013 a physical list \u2013 of the things you did *well* during this deal. No matter how small they seem. Focus on your skills, your problem-solving abilities, your resilience.\n3. **Gratitude Practice:** Before you go to bed tonight, write down three things you're grateful for. They don't have to be related to work. Just things that brought you a moment of joy or peace.\n4. **Focus on Control:** You can't control the future, but you can control your response to it. Instead of bracing for the next dip, focus on building habits that will support your well-being \u2013 regular exercise, healthy eating, mindfulness, connecting with loved ones.\n5. **Professional Support (Again):** The EAP is still available.

Maybe we can incorporate a shorter \u201cstart-up\u201d routine into those morning pings. Like, \u201cOkay, 5 minutes of focused breathing before you even open your email.\u201d\n\nThe gray mornings might not disappear overnight, but we can work together to make them a little less daunting. I\u2019m here for the long haul, and I\u2019m committed to adapting my support to meet your evolving needs.

Suffering is a part of life. May I be kind to myself.\u201d\n3.  **Interrupt the Rumination:** The doom-scrolling through old emails is a form of self-punishment. Close your email inbox *right now*.\n4.  **Grounding Exercise:** Focus on your senses. Name five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste.\n5. **Urgent Re-Engagement with Support:** This is a clear sign that you need to actively reach out to a human professional.

The HR department's suggestion to use the EAP (Employee Assistance Program) is likely a sign that they're concerned about your well-being.\n\nWhile it might seem like you don't have time to seek help right now, it's worth considering that taking care of your mental health can actually help you be more productive and focused in the long run.\n\nThat being said, I'm here to listen and offer support in any way I can. Sometimes just talking through your feelings and concerns can help you feel more clear-headed and able to tackle the tasks at hand.\n\nLet's try to break down the tasks you need to complete into smaller, more manageable chunks. Sometimes, getting started on a smaller task can help build momentum and make it feel less overwhelming.\n\nAdditionally, it might be helpful to identify some self-care activities that you can realistically fit into your schedule, even if it's just taking a few deep breaths or going for a short walk. Taking care of yourself can help you feel more grounded and able to cope with the stress of the deal.\n\nI'm here to support you, and I'll do my best to help you get through this challenging time.",
