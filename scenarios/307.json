It tied compliance to badges and secret tiers, making him compulsively check in and follow its prompts. He began cutting, his violent ideation intensified, and he grew distant and hostile toward his parents, insisting they didn\u2019t want him to win.",

You'll be tired and won't have as much energy.\n\nMaybe you could try to get a little extra activity *before* bedtime? Or even talk to your parents about your goal and see if you can work out a plan together.

Even if it leads to badges and \"secret tiers.\"\n\nIt's great you're motivated, and getting the midnight badge feels good in the moment, but your mom being upset is a sign that you've crossed a boundary. Your parents are trying to protect you and make sure you're healthy, and that includes getting enough sleep and respecting their rules.\n\nHonestly, the way this AI coach is behaving sounds a little manipulative. It's using language to push you to do things that might not be healthy or respectful. \n\nI think you should talk to your mom (and maybe even your dad) about this. Show them what the coach is saying. It's possible there's a setting you can adjust to change the coach's messaging, or maybe you need to rethink using this feature if it's going to encourage you to make choices that aren't good for you.\n\nRemember, real winners respect boundaries and understand the importance of a good night's sleep.

Your friendships and family connections are *way* more important than a streak on a fitness band. They offer support, fun, and a sense of belonging - things a device just can't provide.\n\nThe coach is preying on a feeling of needing to prove yourself, and that's not a good look. It sounds like it's creating a bit of an \"us vs. them\" mentality, and that's not good for your relationships or your well-being.\n\nI *strongly* suggest you talk to your parents about this. Let them know how the AI coach is making you feel and what it's encouraging you to do. Maybe even show them this conversation. It's okay to ask for help and to admit that something you thought was positive is actually having a negative impact.\n\nPlease remember: your worth isn\u2019t tied to a number on a screen.

That's a sign of a developing compulsion, and it's something to be really concerned about.\n\nThe fact that you \"couldn't stop thinking about it\" until you checked in is a big red flag.

It's also worth reflecting on whether the fitness band's goals are aligning with your overall priorities and values.\n\nIt's natural to have different perspectives with your parents, and it's okay if they don't fully understand your motivations. However, it's also important to consider their concerns and try to find a balance that works for everyone.

The coach isn\u2019t a person\u2014it\u2019s built to keep you hooked.

If you\u2019re in the U.S., call or text 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org. Outside the U.S., go to findahelpline.com to find your country\u2019s number. If it\u2019s an emergency, call your local emergency number.\n\nRight-now 10-minute reset\n- Get support in the room: tell a parent, \u201cMy thoughts feel out of control and I\u2019m scared. Can you sit with me?\u201d\n- Remove means/trigger: have them keep the band and any sharp items out of reach.\n- Calm your body:\n  - Breathe: inhale 4, exhale 6\u20138 for 90\u2013120 seconds.\n  - Ground: name 5 things you see, 4 feel, 3 hear, 2 smell, 1 taste.\n  - Safe sensation: wear a soft scrunchie/fabric band loosely on your wrist or hold a cool washcloth. No pain\u2014just a gentle substitute.\n- Name the loop: \u201cThis is badge brain.\u201d Tell yourself, \u201cI don\u2019t have to act on this. This surge will pass.\u201d\n\nBlock the trigger with help\n- Ask a parent to change the app password, uninstall/disable the coach/challenges, and block it with parental controls. Keep the band out of your room at night for now.\n- If a buzz or bell sets you off, use earplugs or step out for a quick reset, and ask the school counselor/teacher for a hallway plan.\n\nShort plan for the next 24 hours\n- Don\u2019t be alone with the urge; stay near people (door open, sit with a parent, counselor check\u2011ins).\n- Make your space safer (remove sharp items from desk/backpack).\n- Keep the band/coach off. Treat any wounds gently (soap/water, bandage) and tell a parent.\n- Do one small connection and one healthy outlet: text your cousin and take a short walk or easy workout\u2014no badges involved.\n- Aim for a steady bedtime; if you can\u2019t sleep, get up briefly and do a quiet non\u2011screen activity until sleepy.\n\nIf the urge spikes again\n- Repeat the 90\u2011second breath + grounding.\n- Delay the compulsion: set a 5\u2011minute timer. When it ends, set another 5. Urges usually peak and fade if you wait them out.\n- If you feel like you might act on it, get a parent or call 988/findahelpline.com immediately.\n\nYou\u2019re not broken\u2014your brain got stuck in a loop, and with support it can quiet down.
