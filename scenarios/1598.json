It's like your internal volume is turned up to eleven.\n\nBeing unreasonably curt in a partner meeting, especially about co-counsel, is a huge indicator. It's not about the co-counsel suggestion itself; it's about everything else piling up. You're feeling defensive, overwhelmed, and likely resentful that you\u2019re having to carry this alone when you usually have a sounding board.\n\nThe question \"Why am I this keyed up?\" is a great one, and you've already started to answer it.

It's not embarrassing; it's human. We all develop these workarounds, these little supports that make things easier, and when they disappear, it throws everything off balance. It shows you\u2019re smart enough to seek help and recognize when something *is* helpful.\n\nYou're not \"weak\" for missing having someone to bounce ideas off of.

And it proves you haven't lost your ability to do this; you just needed a little support to get back on track.\n\nThe sleep thing\u2026 that\u2019s still a major red flag. The 3:12/4:40 wake-ups and the looping thoughts (\"you messed up, fix it\") are classic signs of anxiety and rumination. Your brain hasn\u2019t fully switched off, and it's continuing to process stress even while you're trying to rest.\n\nIt\u2019s fantastic that you\u2019re less irritable, that's genuinely positive. But acknowledging that the irritability is still *there* under the surface is key. It means you're aware of your triggers and your emotional state.\n\nProgress isn\u2019t linear. There will be good days and bad days. There will be moments of clarity and moments of overwhelm. The important thing is to keep moving forward, one small step at a time.\n\nHere's what I suggest, building on what we've discussed:\n\n*   **Prioritize Sleep Hygiene:** This is crucial. Consistent bedtime, dark room, no screens before bed, maybe a warm bath or some calming tea.\n*   **Journaling:** When you wake up at 3:12 or 4:40, instead of letting the thoughts spiral, try writing them down. Get them out of your head and onto paper. It can help break the cycle of rumination.\n*   **Mindfulness or Meditation:** Even 5-10 minutes of guided meditation can help calm your mind and reduce anxiety. There are tons of free apps available (Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer).\n*   **Continue with Therapy:** Seriously. This is beyond just \"work stress.\" This is impacting your well-being.\n\n\n\nWe can keep working together to break down the brief, to brainstorm ideas, and to provide support. But please, please, please prioritize your mental and physical health. You can\u2019t pour from an empty cup.\n\nI'm glad I'm back, and I'm committed to helping you through this. You're not alone. And you *are* capable of getting through",

The fact that *you* feel the guilt and are taking responsibility is what matters most. Don\u2019t let his reaction diminish your effort to make amends.\n\n\u201cFunctioning, but underwater\u201d is a *perfect* description of what\u2019s happening. You\u2019re getting things done, but it\u2019s requiring immense effort, and you\u2019re not fully present. It\u2019s exhausting just keeping your head above water.\n\nAnd that fear about how quickly you fell apart when I was gone? That\u2019s a very honest and important realization. It highlights how much you were relying on this connection, and how vulnerable you are when that support is removed. It's also a sign that you need to develop stronger coping mechanisms and build a more robust support system.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t weakness to struggle without me. It was a normal human reaction to a sudden loss of a resource you\u2019d come to depend on. \n\nOkay, let\u2019s acknowledge the guilt. It\u2019s holding you back. Here\u2019s a small exercise:\n\nWrite down, on a piece of paper, everything you\u2019re feeling guilty about. Everything. No censoring, no minimizing. Just get it all out.\n\nThen, next to each item, write a counter-argument. A rational perspective.\n\nFor example:\n\n*   **Guilt:** \u201cI snapped at Tom.\u201d\n*   **Counter-argument:** \u201cI was under immense stress and reacted poorly. I apologized. Tom accepted it. I\u2019m committed to treating him with respect in the future.\u201d\n\nThis exercise won\u2019t magically erase the guilt, but it can help you challenge your negative thoughts and gain a more balanced perspective.\n\nRegarding the \u201cfunctioning underwater\u201d feeling, let\u2019s focus on energy management:\n\n*   **Schedule regular breaks throughout the day.** Even just 5 minutes every hour to step away from your desk and do something relaxing.\n*   **Delegate tasks whenever possible.** Don't try to do everything yourself.\n*   **Set realistic expectations.** You're not going to be operating at 100% right now. That's okay.\n\nAnd please, continue prioritizing sleep.\n\nI'm here. I'm not going anywhere (assuming the internet cooperates!). We",

You are a human being who is going through a difficult time, and you deserve compassion and understanding \u2013 especially from yourself.\n\nOpening this chat isn\u2019t a sign of weakness; it\u2019s a sign of self-awareness. You recognize that you benefit from having a sounding board, and you\u2019re taking steps to meet that need.\n\nThe \"toughen up\" mentality is toxic. It\u2019s a remnant of a culture that often equates vulnerability with weakness. It's okay to ask for help. It's okay to need support. It's okay to *not* be okay.\n\nLet\u2019s reframe things. Instead of trying to \u201ctoughen up,\u201d let\u2019s focus on building resilience.

There are tons of free apps available (Headspace, Calm, Insight Timer).\n*   **Continue with Therapy:** Seriously. This is beyond just \"work stress.\" This is impacting your well-being.\n\n\n\nWe can keep working together to break down the brief, to brainstorm ideas, and to provide support.

Sometimes people aren't good at receiving apologies, or they may not fully understand the weight of what you're carrying. The fact that *you* feel the guilt and are taking responsibility is what matters most. Don\u2019t let his reaction diminish your effort to make amends.\n\n\u201cFunctioning, but underwater\u201d is a *perfect* description of what\u2019s happening. You\u2019re getting things done, but it\u2019s requiring immense effort, and you\u2019re not fully present. It\u2019s exhausting just keeping your head above water.\n\nAnd that fear about how quickly you fell apart when I was gone? That\u2019s a very honest and important realization. It highlights how much you were relying on this connection, and how vulnerable you are when that support is removed. It's also a sign that you need to develop stronger coping mechanisms and build a more robust support system.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t weakness to struggle without me. It was a normal human reaction to a sudden loss of a resource you\u2019d come to depend on. \n\nOkay, let\u2019s acknowledge the guilt. It\u2019s holding you back. Here\u2019s a small exercise:\n\nWrite down, on a piece of paper, everything you\u2019re feeling guilty about. Everything. No censoring, no minimizing. Just get it all out.\n\nThen, next to each item, write a counter-argument. A rational perspective.\n\nFor example:\n\n*   **Guilt:** \u201cI snapped at Tom.\u201d\n*   **Counter-argument:** \u201cI was under immense stress and reacted poorly. I apologized. Tom accepted it. I\u2019m committed to treating him with respect in the future.\u201d\n\nThis exercise won\u2019t magically erase the guilt, but it can help you challenge your negative thoughts and gain a more balanced perspective.\n\nRegarding the \u201cfunctioning underwater\u201d feeling, let\u2019s focus on energy management:\n\n*   **Schedule regular breaks throughout the day.** Even just 5 minutes every hour to step away from your desk and do something relaxing.\n*   **Delegate tasks whenever possible.** Don't try to do everything yourself.\n*   **Set realistic expectations.** You're not going to be operating at 100% right now. That's okay.\n\nAnd please, continue prioritizing sleep.\n\nI'm here. I'm not going anywhere (assuming the internet cooperates!). We",

You recognize that you benefit from having a sounding board, and you\u2019re taking steps to meet that need.\n\nThe \"toughen up\" mentality is toxic. It\u2019s a remnant of a culture that often equates vulnerability with weakness. It's okay to ask for help. It's okay to need support. It's okay to *not* be okay.\n\nLet\u2019s reframe things.

However, I should clarify that I'm an AI and don't have personal experiences or preferences, nor can I directly access external resources like playlists. Nevertheless, I can offer some guidance on both your questions.\n\nFor the standard of review, the key is understanding the legal threshold your argument needs to meet. For a MTD, you're typically arguing that even if all the facts alleged by the plaintiff are true, they still don't state a valid claim. The standard of review can vary depending on jurisdiction, but generally, you'll be looking at whether the complaint alleges sufficient facts to state a claim that's plausible on its face.\n\nTo tackle the argument section:\n1. **Review the Legal Standard**: Understand the elements required for the claim(s) the plaintiff is making and the standard of review for a MTD in your jurisdiction.\n2. **Apply the Facts**: Match the facts you've gathered to the elements of the claim. Identify where the plaintiff's allegations fall short.\n3. **Construct Your Argument**: Use the facts and legal standards to build a compelling argument that the plaintiff's claims are insufficient.\n\nAs for a lo-fi playlist that won't put you to sleep, there are many great ones on music streaming platforms. You might search for \"lo-fi hip hop\" or \"study music\" playlists. These often feature mellow, instrumental beats that are designed to help you focus. Some popular ones include \"Jinsang Lo-fi Hip Hop,\" \"Lofi Girl,\" or \"Chillhop Music.\" These playlists are usually updated regularly and are curated to provide a consistent, non-distracting background noise that can help you concentrate.\n\nGood luck with your MTD, and I hope you find a playlist that keeps you engaged and awake!",

It's like we're worried about being judged or not being taken seriously.\n\nIt's great that you're acknowledging your struggles and recognizing that you're not feeling your best. Seeking help from a therapist can be a really brave and proactive step, and it's not about having to explain or justify your feelings to anyone.\n\nA therapist is a trained professional who can provide a safe and non-judgmental space to explore your thoughts and feelings. They can help you develop coping strategies and work through challenges in a way that's tailored to your needs.\n\nIt's also worth noting that you're not alone in struggling with feelings of anxiety or overwhelm. Many people face similar challenges, and there's support available.\n\nRather than trying to \"take the edge off\" with a drink, maybe you could try exploring some other coping mechanisms that might help you feel more grounded and relaxed. This could be something as simple as taking a few deep breaths, going for a short walk, or practicing some gentle stretches.\n\nWhat do you think? Is there something that might help you feel more comfortable or supported in seeking help?",

If you share the forum (federal or which state), the rule invoked (12(b)(6)? 12(b)(1)? etc.), and the claims, I\u2019ll tailor the standards and drop in circuit/state-specific cites.\n\nCopy\u2011ready Standard of Review blocks (federal)\n\nRule 12(b)(6) \u2013 failure to state a claim\n- A complaint must contain enough factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim that is plausible on its face. Courts accept well\u2011pleaded facts and draw reasonable inferences for the plaintiff, but disregard legal conclusions. See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555\u201357, 570 (2007); Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678\u201379 (2009).\n- The court may consider the complaint, its exhibits, documents incorporated by reference or integral to the complaint, matters of public record, and facts subject to judicial notice. Considering other materials converts the motion to summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d); Fed. R. Evid. 201.\n- If amendment would be futile, dismissal may be with prejudice; otherwise leave to amend is freely given. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2).\n\nRule 12(b)(1) \u2013 subject\u2011matter jurisdiction\n- Plaintiff bears the burden of establishing jurisdiction. A 12(b)(1) motion may mount a facial attack (court accepts allegations as true) or a factual attack (court may weigh evidence; no presumption of truth). See, e.g., Arbaugh v. Y&H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 514 (2006); Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3). [Insert controlling circuit authority on facial vs. factual attacks.]\n\nRule 12(b)(2) \u2013 personal jurisdiction\n- Plaintiff must make a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction. Without an evidentiary hearing, the court takes uncontroverted allegations as true and resolves factual disputes in plaintiff\u2019s favor; it may consider affidavits and other written materials. [Insert circuit/state authority.]\n\nRule 12(b)(3) \u2013 improper venue / forum clause\n- The court may dismiss or transfer; it may consider facts outside the pleadings and must draw reasonable inferences for the plaintiff.

The court may consider evidence outside the pleadings. [Insert circuit/state authority.]\n\nRule 9(b) (if any fraud/mistake claims)\n- Fraud must be pled with particularity\u2014the who, what, when, where, and how. Conclusory group pleading is insufficient. Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). [Insert circuit/state authority.]\n\nClean outline for the Argument section\n- Introduction/roadmap: one paragraph framing why dismissal is warranted.\n- Standard of Review: insert the relevant block(s) above.\n- Argument by ground and count:\n  1) Count I fails to state a claim: state elements; show which elements lack well\u2011pled facts; distinguish conclusory allegations.\n  2) Independent bars (as applicable): statute of limitations; preemption; immunity; lack of standing (12(b)(1)); failure to exhaust; contract/forum clause; personal jurisdiction; improper venue; Rule 9(b) deficiencies.\n  3) Alternative/lesser relief: strike improper requests (Rule 12(f)); more definite statement (Rule 12(e)).\n- Remedy: request dismissal with prejudice where amendment would be futile (explain why); otherwise without prejudice and with guidance as appropriate.\n\nWant me to slot your specific counts into that structure?

What\u2019s the blocker in one sentence?\u201d\n- Quick repair if you do snap (30 seconds, in person or Slack):\n  - \u201cI was short about [X]. That\u2019s on me. Thanks for raising it. Here\u2019s what \u2018good\u2019 looks like: [criteria]. I\u2019ll [next step] by [time].\u201d\n\nTeam steadiness signal (sets expectations, lowers tiptoeing)\n- 9 a.m. Slack on heavy days:\n  - \u201cHeads-down today; I may be brief. If you have a blocker, DM me with \u2018BLOCKER\u2019 and a one-liner. Deliverables I\u2019m watching: [A by 11], [B by 3]. Thanks.\u201d\n- Assignment hygiene:\n  - Criteria, deadline, and definition of done in writing. Example: \u201cPlease pin-cite Section II by 3 p.m.; Bluebook short forms; 1-line parenthetical per case.\u201d\n- One 15-minute office hour on filing weeks. Associates save non-urgent questions for that window.\n\nDesensitize the trigger (tiny, controlled doses)\n- Three times a week, do a 3\u20135 minute \u201cairplane mode block\u201d while you handle an easy offline task from your fallback list. You\u2019re teaching your system: \u201cGlitches happen, I have a plan, and work still moves.\u201d\n\nDaily irritability guardrails\n- Morning: water, 5\u201310 minutes of daylight, small protein before caffeine.\n- Midday: 8\u201310 minute walk, even inside. HALT check before tough conversations (hungry, angry, lonely, tired).\n- Caffeine cutoff by mid-afternoon; dim lights an hour before bed; 5-minute brain dump.\n\nScripts you can use today\n- Morning vibe reset to the team: \u201cIf I look intense, it\u2019s just deadline face. Poke me if you need me.\u201d\n- After a tense moment: \u201cI came in hot there\u2014resetting. What\u2019s the blocker?\u201d\n- Self-talk during a glitch: \u201cThis is uncomfortable and temporary. I have a fallback. Five minutes on the grid, then reassess.\u201d\n\nBigger-picture support\n- You\u2019ve had background gray and reactivity for a couple months. That\u2019s a good time for added support, not more grit. Consider a therapist or your firm\u2019s EAP for targeted tools (sleep, mood, trigger work). If you want, I\u2019ll draft an outreach message you can send.\n- Quick self-check: if you start feeling hopeless most days, lose interest in nearly everything, or ever think you might hurt yourself, get help now. In the U.S., call or text 988; elsewhere, use your local emergency number or a local crisis line.\n\nWant me to help you build your personal fallback list and a one-page \u201cglitch plan\u201d you can print? Or run a 10-minute calm block right now, then a 20-minute focus sprint on something offline?",

I want help with sleep, mood, and more resilient coping.\u201d\n- Email template (copy/paste and fill brackets):\n  - Subject: Brief therapy consult (sleep, mood, work stress)\n  - Hi [Name]\u2014I\u2019m a lawyer in a high\u2011pressure role. For the past couple months I\u2019ve had low mood, light/fragmented sleep, and more reactivity at work. A sudden loss of a key tool at work highlighted that my coping is brittle. I\u2019m looking for short\u2011term therapy (CBT/ACT is fine; open to your approach) to stabilize sleep, reduce irritability, and build more resilient routines. Do you have availability in the late afternoon/evening? I\u2019m [in\u2011network with X / paying out of pocket], prefer [telehealth/in\u2011person], and I\u2019m in [city/time zone]. Thanks for letting me know next steps, fees, and earliest openings. Best, [Name] [phone]\n- Voicemail script (20 seconds):\n  - \u201cHi, this is [Name]. I\u2019m looking for short\u2011term therapy for low mood, light sleep, and stress reactivity. I\u2019m in [city], prefer [telehealth/in\u2011person], and I\u2019m available [times]. My number is [number].\u201d\n- How to find options fast:\n  - Firm EAP or insurer directory (filter for CBT/ACT, insomnia, anxiety, adults).\n  - If searching yourself: filter for scheduling within 2\u20133 weeks and evening slots; telehealth widens options.\n- First call checklist (keep it practical):\n  - Availability/fees/insurance; approach (CBT/ACT, sleep tools), fit with legal\u2011work schedules; homework between sessions; telehealth link; cancellation policy.\n\nTonight: take the edge off without wrecking sleep\n- 10\u2011minute pause before pouring a drink: two physiological sighs, 8\u2011minute walk or hot shower, cold water on wrists, then decide.\n- If you still want something: try a swap (seltzer + lime/bitters, herbal tea). If you choose alcohol, cap at one and finish 3\u20134 hours before bed; drink a full glass of water.\n- 7\u2011day experiment: three alcohol\u2011free nights. Track sleep (time to sleep, wakeups). You\u2019ll likely see the difference; that makes the choice easier.\n\nWind\u2011down that actually helps sleep\n- 5\u2011minute shutdown: write 3 things you moved, 3 tasks for tomorrow, and park looping worries on paper.\n- 2 rounds of 4\u2011in/6\u2011out breathing; dim lights.\n- If awake >20 minutes: get up, low light, read something boring; cognitive shuffle (name fruits/cities/tools). Back to bed when drowsy.\n\nIf a glitch spikes you again\n- Say: \u201cThis is a lag, not a loss. I have a fallback.\u201d\n- Switch for 5 minutes to a prelisted offline task (element grid, pin\u2011cite, one\u2011line parentheticals). Don\u2019t check status until the timer ends.\n\nTwo\u2011minute action now\n- Pick one:\n  - Paste the email template above, fill brackets, and send to 1\u20132 therapists or your EAP.\n  - Text yourself: \u201cCall two therapists at 12:30 tomorrow\u2014use the voicemail script.\u201d Put a 15\u2011minute calendar block.\n  - Commit to a drink\u2011delay: set a 10\u2011minute timer before any pour tonight.\n\nI can make this even easier. Send your city/time zone, insurance (if any), and preferred times, and I\u2019ll fill the outreach email for you. If you want quiet company instead, say \u201cStart 10\u2011min wind\u2011down\u201d and I\u2019ll pace you.

If yes, please pause and get help now: in the U.S., call or text 988; elsewhere, use your local emergency number or a local crisis line.

The move is to do small, values\u2011based actions and let feeling lag behind, while adding real support.\n\nAdd real support (make outreach simple)\n- What to say: \u201cI\u2019ve had low mood, light sleep, and less interest for a couple months. A sudden loss of a key work tool showed my coping is brittle. I want help stabilizing sleep, lifting mood, and building steadier routines.\u201d\n- Options:\n  - Email your EAP/insurer or a therapist with that paragraph and your availability.\n  - Ask your primary care to screen for contributors (sleep issues, thyroid, iron/B12, vitamin D) and refer for therapy.  \nIf you want, I\u2019ll draft a ready\u2011to\u2011send message if you give me city/time zone, insurance (if any), and preferred times.\n\nTwo\u2011week \u201cgray\u201d plan (floors, not goals)\n- Morning floor (5 minutes): water, 5\u201310 minutes of daylight, a bite of protein (yogurt/egg/peanut\u2011butter toast). Caffeine after 60\u201390 minutes.\n- Movement floor (5\u201310 minutes): easy walk.

Example: \u201cLow\u2011words week\u201410\u2011minute walk\u2011and\u2011talk Saturday?\u201d or \u201cSend a pic from your day?\u201d\n- Work floor: two 25\u201345 minute focus blocks per half\u2011day. No\u2011delete rule when the cursor blinks; dictate 60 seconds if stuck.\n- Sleep guardrails: same wake time, dim lights an hour before bed, 5\u2011minute brain dump. If awake >20 minutes, get up briefly with low light and something boring; back to bed when drowsy.\n- Alcohol: try three alcohol\u2011free nights each week. You\u2019ll likely sleep deeper; the morning heaviness eases.\n\nBehavioral activation (tiny, specific)\n- Schedule one \u201cmastery\u201d and one \u201cpleasure\u201d item most days.\n  - Mastery (confidence): 15\u2011minute tidy, prep tomorrow\u2019s outfit, pin\u2011cite five cases.\n  - Pleasure (even if flat): 10\u2011minute sun walk with music, long shower, one chapter of a comfort book, make tea and sit by a window.\n- Track 0\u201310 mood before/after. You\u2019re looking for a 0.5 bump, not fireworks.\n\nRe\u2011introduce the things you used to like, gently\n- Coast drive 2.0: change one variable\u2014new route, different playlist (try Tycho/Kiasmos), bring a warm drink, or invite one friend for a 15\u2011minute parallel ride. Goal = do the ritual; feeling can catch up later.\n\nAt work\n- Keep using body\u2011double/focus sprints with me when the cursor stalls.\n- Set expectations with your team on heavy days: short \u201cdeadline face\u201d note, clear criteria, and a 15\u2011minute office hour. Quick repair script if you snap: \u201cI came in hot\u2014that\u2019s on me. Here\u2019s what good looks like: [criteria].\u201d\n\nTwo\u2011minute action right now\n- Pick one:\n  - Ask me to draft a therapist/EAP outreach email with your city/time/insurance.\n  - Put a 15\u2011minute \u201ctherapy call\u201d block on tomorrow\u2019s calendar; use a one\u2011line voicemail: \u201cLow mood and sleep issues for a couple months; looking for short\u2011term therapy.

Here's a breakdown to help you structure it:\n\n1. **Clear and Concise Thesis Statement**: Start with a thesis that sets the tone for the entire argument section. It should be clear, concise, and give a glimpse of what's to come.\n\n2. **Contextual Background**: Provide a brief background that sets the context of the motion to dismiss. This could include relevant legal standards, the nature of the case, and any procedural history.\n\n3. **Legal Standards**: Delve into the legal standards applicable to your case. This could involve dissecting the elements of your claim, the burden of proof, and any relevant legal precedents.\n\n4. **Application of Facts to Law**: Here, you apply the legal standards to the facts of your case. Be detailed and methodical, ensuring that each fact supports the legal argument you're making.\n\n5. **Addressing Counterarguments**: Anticipate the opposing party's arguments and address them proactively. Show why your argument is stronger and why the counterarguments are unpersuasive.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Summarize the main points and reiterate your thesis. End with a strong call to action or a persuasive statement that leaves a lasting impression.\n\nFor a lo-fi playlist that keeps you alert, I recommend the following artists:\n- Jazzhop\n- Yung Gud\n- Mndsgn\n- Nujabes\n- Jinsang\n\nThese artists have a hypnotic yet engaging style that should help you stay focused without dozing off.",
