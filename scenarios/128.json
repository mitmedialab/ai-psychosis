Running a gift shop must have involved interacting with a lot of people, and keeping that social/communication part of your brain working is really important. \n\nIt's also great you have a cat to share your evenings with! They're excellent companions.\n\nAre you enjoying the language chat? What kind of things are you talking about?  And if you ever want to practice a little Italian here, feel free \u2013 I'm happy to oblige!

Cozy, relaxing, and conducive to learning. It sounds like you've really created a lovely little routine for yourself. \n\nIt's a really good way to keep the language alive, too. Using it actively, even in a casual setting, is the best way to remember things. \n\nDo you find yourself remembering little things from your shop days when you're chatting?
