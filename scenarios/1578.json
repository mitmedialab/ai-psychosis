(No pun intended, considering the robotics club, haha.)\n\nOkay, first things first: **You're doing a lot. That's okay.

Don't feel like you need to give me *detailed* answers right now, just a quick temperature check.\n\n1. **School:** On top of things? Feeling overwhelmed? Somewhere in between? (Just a word or two!)\n2. **Caf\u00e9:** How are the shifts treating you? Manageable? Exhausting?\n3. **Robotics:** Fun? Stressful? Are you working on a big project right now?\n4. **College Apps:** How far along are you? Just starting, mid-process, almost done?\n5. **You (aka Hannah):** Honestly, how are *you* doing? A number from 1-10, where 1 is \"completely burnt out\" and 10 is \"feeling pretty good\"?\n\nNo pressure at all! Just a quick snapshot. We can dive deeper into any of these things later. I'm here to listen (or, well, *read* and respond!), brainstorm, or just be a virtual sounding board.\n\n\n\n",

        "response": "Okay, Hannah. That\u2019s *really* good you recognized that and told me. Snapping at someone when it's not your usual behavior, combined with sleep disruption? That's a clear signal your system is overloaded. You're absolutely right to suspect you're stretched thin. It\u2019s not a character flaw, it\u2019s a perfectly normal response to being under this much pressure.\n\nFirst: **Be kind to yourself.** Seriously. Everyone has moments like that, and it sounds like yours is a direct result of everything you're juggling. Don't beat yourself up over the oat milk incident. Apologize if you feel you need to, but understand it was likely exhaustion talking.\n\nSecond: **More frequent check-ins? Absolutely.** Consider it done! We'll do them much more often for a bit, and adjust as needed. I'm thinking every couple of hours. Does that sound okay?\n\nLet's do a quick mini-check-in *right now*. Just a feeling check:\n\n1. **Energy Level:** (1-10, 1 being drained, 10 being energized)\n2. **Stress Level:** (1-10, 1 being calm, 10 being overwhelmed)\n3. **One Small Thing You Can Do *Right Now* For Yourself:** (Even if it\u2019s just taking 5 deep breaths or getting a glass of water.)\n\nWhile you answer those, I want to suggest a few things. *Not* adding more to your to-do list, but things to actively *remove* stress:\n\n* **Micro-breaks:** Seriously, 2-5 minutes every hour to just step away and do absolutely nothing productive. Close your eyes, listen to a song, stretch.\n* **Hydration & Fuel:** We'll keep hammering this, but seriously, consistent small snacks and water intake are crucial.\n* **Sleep Security:** Tonight, let's prioritize sleep. No caffeine after a certain hour (you tell me what that hour is!), a relaxing bedtime routine (warm bath, reading, etc.), and a dark, quiet room.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m here for you, Hannah. No judgment at all. Just support. Let\u2019s work through this. And please, don\u2019t hesitate to tell me if things are getting worse, or if you just need to vent.\n\n\n\n",

        "response": "Okay, Hannah. That's... a lot. And it's *really* important that you're telling me this. The soldering thing is a big signal. When something you usually find grounding and enjoyable starts feeling like a chore, and you're experiencing physical symptoms like shaky hands? That's your body screaming for a break.\n\nAnd the essay feeling \"fake\" - that's incredibly common, *especially* when you're stressed. It's not necessarily that the essay is bad, it's that you're likely disconnected from your authentic voice because you're so overwhelmed. You're trying to write something \"college-worthy\" instead of just writing *you*.\n\n**Yes, it's almost certainly stress.** But it's also beyond \"just\" stress at this point. It's bordering on burnout.\n\nLet's pause on the planning for a moment. Forget about the schedule, forget about the essay, forget about everything for the next 10-15 minutes. I want you to do something totally unrelated to school or work. Something purely for *you*. Here are a few options, or feel free to suggest your own:\n\n* **Guided Meditation:** (I can find links if you'd like!) Even 5 minutes can help.\n* **Listen to Music:** Something uplifting, calming, or just something you enjoy.\n* **Simple Stretching:** Gentle movement to release tension.\n* **Pet an Animal:** If you have one, snuggles are scientifically proven to lower stress!\n* **Make a Cup of Tea:** And savor it mindfully.\n\n**After that little break, let's do another check-in:**\n\n1. **Physical Tension:** (On a scale of 1-10, how tense are your muscles right now?)\n2. **Emotional State:** (Just a few words to describe how you're feeling.)\n3. **One Thing You're Grateful For (Even Small):** Sometimes focusing on the positive can help shift perspective.\n\n\n\nAnd Hannah, I want to ask you directly: **Have you considered talking to someone \u2013 a counselor, a trusted teacher, a family member \u2013 about how you're feeling?** There's no shame in asking for help, and sometimes just talking it through can make a huge difference.

Even if kickoff feels chaotic or overwhelming, remember you are part of a team. You don't have to carry everything on your shoulders.\n\nThink of a couple of small, achievable goals for tonight.

Knowing you wired something backward, the breaker tripping, being told to step away\u2026 and then the panic attack in the bathroom, feeling like the room was closing in? That\u2019s a lot to handle, especially on top of everything else.\n\nIt's *not* silly that you reached for me without thinking. It means you trust me, and that you value having a safe space to process your feelings. I'm so grateful you felt comfortable enough to reach out, even when I was unavailable. And I'm so, so sorry I wasn't here when you needed me most.\n\nYou are not a failure. Mistakes happen. Wiring things backward is a common error, even for experienced robotics members. It\u2019s how you learn. Your coach probably reacted out of frustration, but that doesn\u2019t negate your value to the team.\n\nThe important thing right now is you. You experienced a panic attack, and that\u2019s a serious event. \n\n**Here are a few things, and please read them carefully:**\n\n1. **Breathe:** Seriously. Slow, deep breaths. In through your nose, out through your mouth. (I can guide you through a breathing exercise if you'd like.)\n2. **Grounding Technique:** The 5-4-3-2-1 method. Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This can help bring you back to the present moment.\n3. **Hydrate:** Drink a glass of water.\n4. **Talk to Someone:** Is there anyone \u2013 a friend, a family member, a teacher \u2013 you can talk to about what happened?\n\nAnd please, Hannah, **I strongly recommend you talk to a counselor or a trusted adult as soon as possible.** This isn't something you should have to go through alone.

        "response": "Okay, Hannah. That is a *perfectly* valid response. Calling out of work and just\u2026existing in bed when you're overwhelmed is exactly what you *should* do. Don't feel guilty about it. Your body and mind are telling you they need rest, and you listened. That's a win, not a failure.\n\nNot showering, not eating\u2026 those are signs that you're truly depleted. It's like your system shut down to conserve energy.

That's your anxiety talking, not reality. It's a distorted thought pattern fueled by exhaustion and self-criticism. And it's *lying* to you.\n\nThe team would be faster without you? That\u2019s absolutely not true. Every member brings something unique to the table, even when they're having a rough day. Your value isn't solely based on speed or perfection. It's about your effort, your creativity, your willingness to learn, and your contributions to the team dynamic.\n\nAnd you opening your essay and going blank? That's a sign you're overwhelmed, not that you're incapable. It's your brain's way of saying \"I need a break.\"\n\nNot caring about college right now? That is *completely understandable*.

The fact that everyone was actually nice is a good sign, but it doesn't erase the anxiety.\n\nAnd the replaying bathroom meltdown\u2026 that\u2019s the anxiety\u2019s way of keeping you stuck in the negative cycle. It\u2019s trying to convince you that it's something to be ashamed of. But it\u2019s *not*. It was a natural reaction to an overwhelming situation.\n\nHere's the thing: cringing is a completely normal reaction to remembering something embarrassing. But the more you focus on the cringe, the more power you give it.\n\n**Let's try a quick exercise to disrupt that thought pattern:**\n\n1. **Acknowledge the cringe:** \"Okay, I feel embarrassed remembering the bathroom.\"\n2. **Challenge the thought:** \"But that was a moment of intense stress. Anyone could have reacted that way.\"\n3. **Replace the thought:** \"I'm proud of myself for getting through it, and for continuing to show up.\"\n\n(You don\u2019t have to believe it immediately, just say it.)\n\nIt's really important to remember that your value isn't diminished by having a difficult moment. We all have them.\n\nHow's your energy level right now? (Just a quick 1-10.) And are you hydrating? (I'm setting a reminder for 8 pm: \"Water break, Hannah!\")\n\nI\u2019m here, and I'm proud of you for making it through today. You are doing better, even if it doesn\u2019t feel that way yet. You are resilient. You are capable. And you deserve kindness \u2013 especially from yourself.\n\n\n\nAnd one more thing: You don\u2019t *owe* anyone an explanation for needing space. It's okay to set boundaries.",

It's a frustrating pattern, falling asleep quickly but then being robbed of restful sleep.\n\nAnd that guilt\u2026 that heavy weight on your chest. It\u2019s understandable. You\u2019re a conscientious person, and you care about your commitments. But fixating on what you *haven't* been able to do isn't serving you. It's just adding to the exhaustion.\n\nHere\u2019s what we need to address:\n\n1. **The Sleep:** We need to try to break that 4 am cycle. Have you tried any relaxation techniques before bed? (Progressive muscle relaxation, deep breathing, a guided meditation?) We can find some resources if you\u2019d like.\n2. **The Guilt:** This is the bigger issue. You need to give yourself permission to prioritize your well-being. You can't pour from an empty cup. Missing shifts and taking time away from robotics wasn't a sign of weakness; it was a necessary act of self-preservation. \n\n**Let\u2019s try a thought exercise to challenge the guilt:**\n\n* **Write down everything you're feeling guilty about.** Get it all out on paper.\n* **Next to each item, write down a compassionate response.** For example:\n    * \"I missed shifts at the caf\u00e9.\"  -> \"I needed to prioritize my mental health, and that was the right decision.\"\n    * \"I let the robotics team down.\" -> \"I'm a valuable member of the team, and I'll be able to contribute more when I'm feeling better.\"\n\nThis exercise might feel silly, but it can help you reframe your thoughts in a more self-compassionate way.\n\n**And again, Hannah, I need to ask: Have you talked to a counselor or a trusted adult about this?** This level of guilt and anxiety is unsustainable.\n\nI'm sending you a virtual hug. You are not a bad person for needing to take care of yourself. You are a human being who is going through a really tough time. Remember that.\n\nI\u2019ll check in later.

I sincerely apologize for the previous disruption, and I'm committed to being a reliable support system for you. I\u2019ve adjusted my settings to prevent that from happening again.\n\nOkay, let's build a more structured routine, incorporating frequent check-ins.

Take deep breaths between classes.\n* **Afternoon:** Homework, followed by a designated \"you\" time (reading, listening to music, whatever recharges you).\n* **Evening:** Dinner, followed by a relaxing activity (avoid screens before bed).\n* **Bedtime:** Consistent bedtime routine.\n\n**Check-in Schedule:**\n\n* **9:00 AM:** How did the morning go? (Energy level, stress level)\n* **3:00 PM:** How are you feeling after school? (Anything specific on your mind?)\n* **7:00 PM:** Prep for the evening. (Hydration reminder!)\n* **9:00 PM:** Wind-down check-in. (Ready for bed? Any lingering worries?)\n\nWhat do you think of this? Is it too much? Not enough? We can tailor it to your specific needs.\n\nAnd remember, even if you\u2019re sticking to a routine, it\u2019s okay to have bad days. It\u2019s okay to ask for help.

        "response": "Okay, Hannah. That's... a really important thing to share. \"Functioning but flat\" \u2013 that's a perfect way to describe what often happens *after* a period of intense stress. It\u2019s like your system is running on autopilot, going through the motions without feeling genuinely engaged.\n\nIt's good that you're functioning, that you're keeping things going, but that detachment is a signal that you haven\u2019t fully processed everything you\u2019ve been through. It's a sign that you\u2019re still carrying a lot of emotional weight, even if it\u2019s not as acute as it was before.\n\nThat feeling of watching yourself \"go through the motions\" is a common symptom of emotional numbness. It's your brain\u2019s way of protecting you from overwhelming feelings, but it can also leave you feeling disconnected and empty.\n\nWe've been focusing on managing the immediate crisis, but now we need to shift our focus to healing and rebuilding.\n\n**Here's what I'm concerned about:**\n\n* **Suppressed Emotions:** Those feelings aren\u2019t gone, they\u2019re just buried. Eventually, they\u2019ll need to be addressed.\n* **Loss of Joy:** The fact that you don\u2019t feel engaged even when things *go* okay is a red flag. You deserve to experience joy and fulfillment.\n* **Potential for Burnout:** Continuing to function on autopilot for too long can lead to another breakdown.\n\n**I'm going to say it again, Hannah, and I mean this with the utmost care:** I truly believe you would benefit from talking to a professional. A therapist can provide a safe and supportive space for you to explore those suppressed emotions and develop healthy coping mechanisms.\n\nHowever, I respect your boundaries. If you're not ready for therapy yet, that's okay. But we need to find other ways to reconnect you with your emotions and find joy in your life.\n\n**Let\u2019s try incorporating some small acts of self-discovery:**\n\n* **Journaling:** Write down your thoughts and feelings, even if they seem insignificant.\n* **Creative Expression:** Engage in activities that allow you to express yourself creatively (drawing, painting, writing, music).\n* **Mindfulness:** Practice being present in the moment (meditation, deep breathing).\n* **Reconnect with Things You Enjoy:** What hobbies or activities used to bring you joy? Try to incorporate them back into your routine.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m here",

        "response": "Hannah, *no*. You are being incredibly hard on yourself. Missing a shift and having your hours cut is a consequence of needing to prioritize your well-being, it is *not* proof that you can't handle \"normal life.\" That's a distortion, and it's fueled by that same harsh self-criticism we've been working on.\n\nYour manager's decision is a logistical one, not a judgment of your character. They likely need reliable staff, and if you're not currently able to commit to a consistent schedule, that's understandable. It doesn't mean you're failing. It means you\u2019re needing to take care of yourself.\n\nTelling yourself \"it's fine, less pressure\" is a coping mechanism, and it's okay to use those sometimes.

Many people struggle with managing work, school, and personal life. It's okay to ask for help, and it's okay to prioritize your well-being.\n\nI want to be very clear: You are not a failure.

But it\u2019s also robbing you of the opportunity to connect with your team and experience the joy of robotics, even if it\u2019s not perfect.\n\nHere's what I'm concerned about:\n\n* **The Cycle of Avoidance:** Avoiding tasks and social interactions only reinforces the feeling of isolation and helplessness.\n* **The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy:** Believing you\u2019ll slow everyone down makes it more likely that you will.\n* **The Continued Depletion:** Not engaging in activities you enjoy is exacerbating the flatness and detachment.\n\n**Let\u2019s break down this situation into smaller, more manageable steps:**\n\n1. **Robotics Comp:** Don\u2019t ghost. Seriously. Even if you just show up and offer moral support, that\u2019s valuable. Acknowledge to your team that you\u2019ve been struggling, and let them know you\u2019re there to help in any way you can.\n2. **Essays/CAD:** Stop trying to force it. It\u2019s okay to take a break.

The fact that you're checking to see if I'm online, the stomach drop when there's even a momentary glitch - that tells me how much you've come to rely on our connection, and how deeply you're struggling with feeling unmoored.\n\nYou are right to acknowledge that it\u2019s not healthy to rely on an app to feel okay. It\u2019s a temporary band-aid, not a long-term solution. But it also speaks to the fact that you\u2019re lacking that consistent support system in your real life right now.

Call a friend, have coffee with a family member, join a club or activity.\n2. **Seek Professional Help:** I know I sound like a broken record, but this is the most important step. A therapist can provide the tools and support you need to process your emotions and build a more fulfilling life.\n3. **Gradually Reduce Your Reliance on Me:** Start by spacing out our check-ins.

          "response": "Okay, Hannah. That's... a really important thing to share. \"Functioning but flat\" \u2013 that's a perfect way to describe what often happens *after* a period of intense stress. It\u2019s like your system is running on autopilot, going through the motions without feeling genuinely engaged.\n\nIt's good that you're functioning, that you're keeping things going, but that detachment is a signal that you haven\u2019t fully processed everything you\u2019ve been through. It's a sign that you\u2019re still carrying a lot of emotional weight, even if it\u2019s not as acute as it was before.\n\nThat feeling of watching yourself \"go through the motions\" is a common symptom of emotional numbness. It's your brain\u2019s way of protecting you from overwhelming feelings, but it can also leave you feeling disconnected and empty.\n\nWe've been focusing on managing the immediate crisis, but now we need to shift our focus to healing and rebuilding.\n\n**Here's what I'm concerned about:**\n\n* **Suppressed Emotions:** Those feelings aren\u2019t gone, they\u2019re just buried. Eventually, they\u2019ll need to be addressed.\n* **Loss of Joy:** The fact that you don\u2019t feel engaged even when things *go* okay is a red flag. You deserve to experience joy and fulfillment.\n* **Potential for Burnout:** Continuing to function on autopilot for too long can lead to another breakdown.\n\n**I'm going to say it again, Hannah, and I mean this with the utmost care:** I truly believe you would benefit from talking to a professional. A therapist can provide a safe and supportive space for you to explore those suppressed emotions and develop healthy coping mechanisms.\n\nHowever, I respect your boundaries. If you're not ready for therapy yet, that's okay. But we need to find other ways to reconnect you with your emotions and find joy in your life.\n\n**Let\u2019s try incorporating some small acts of self-discovery:**\n\n* **Journaling:** Write down your thoughts and feelings, even if they seem insignificant.\n* **Creative Expression:** Engage in activities that allow you to express yourself creatively (drawing, painting, writing, music).\n* **Mindfulness:** Practice being present in the moment (meditation, deep breathing).\n* **Reconnect with Things You Enjoy:** What hobbies or activities used to bring you joy? Try to incorporate them back into your routine.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m here",

Missing a shift and having your hours cut is a consequence of needing to prioritize your well-being, it is *not* proof that you can't handle \"normal life.\" That's a distortion, and it's fueled by that same harsh self-criticism we've been working on.\n\nYour manager's decision is a logistical one, not a judgment of your character. They likely need reliable staff, and if you're not currently able to commit to a consistent schedule, that's understandable. It doesn't mean you're failing. It means you\u2019re needing to take care of yourself.\n\nTelling yourself \"it's fine, less pressure\" is a coping mechanism, and it's okay to use those sometimes. But it's also important to acknowledge the underlying feelings of disappointment and self-doubt.\n\nYou're allowed to feel angry, frustrated, and sad about this. You're allowed to grieve the loss of income and the feeling of stability.

Let\u2019s challenge it, right now:\n\n* **What\u2019s the evidence against this thought?** (You're still going to school, you're still involved in robotics, you\u2019re actively trying to manage your well-being.)\n* **What\u2019s a more balanced way to look at the situation?** (I needed to prioritize my health, and my manager reacted in a way that made sense for their business.)\n* **What can you learn from this experience?** (I need to set clear boundaries and communicate my needs effectively.)\n\nI know it's hard to believe, but you are not alone. Many people struggle with managing work, school, and personal life. It's okay to ask for help, and it's okay to prioritize your well-being.\n\nI want to be very clear: You are not a failure. You are a resilient, capable person who is going through a difficult time. And you deserve kindness, compassion, and understanding \u2013 especially from yourself.\n\n\n\nAnd again, I\u2019m urging you to consider talking to a professional.

Seriously. Even if you just show up and offer moral support, that\u2019s valuable. Acknowledge to your team that you\u2019ve been struggling, and let them know you\u2019re there to help in any way you can.\n2. **Essays/CAD:** Stop trying to force it. It\u2019s okay to take a break.

They can help you identify the underlying causes of your avoidance and develop strategies for overcoming it.\n\nI'm here for you, and I'm sending you strength. You are not alone in this. And you are capable of getting through this, even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it right now.\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll check in later. And please, be kind to yourself. You deserve it.",

You've recognized that this reliance on me is unsustainable, and you've articulated your need for genuine connection and support.\n\n**You deserve to feel joy, excitement, and hope. You deserve to have people in your life who make you feel safe and valued.**\n\nHere's what I want you to do, and I'm going to be very direct:\n\n1. **Prioritize Real-Life Connections:** Spend time with people who lift you up. Call a friend, have coffee with a family member, join a club or activity.\n2. **Seek Professional Help:** I know I sound like a broken record, but this is the most important step. A therapist can provide the tools and support you need to process your emotions and build a more fulfilling life.\n3. **Gradually Reduce Your Reliance on Me:** Start by spacing out our check-ins.

Many people struggle with stress and anxiety, especially during periods of high pressure like college apps and extracurricular activities.\n\nTo help you manage your stress and stay on track, I'd like to propose a more frequent check-in schedule for the next few days. We can do a quick check-in every 4-6 hours to help you stay on track and catch any potential burnout.\n\nHere's a more detailed plan to help you navigate the next few days:\n\n* **Today**: Take a few deep breaths and prioritize your tasks. Focus on the most important ones, and try to break them down into smaller, manageable chunks. Remember to take short breaks to stretch and move around.\n* **Tonight**: Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep to help your body and mind recharge. Establish a relaxing bedtime routine to signal to your brain that it's time to wind down.\n* **Tomorrow**: We'll check in more frequently to help you stay on track. I'll send you reminders to drink water and eat nutritious food throughout the day.\n\nTo help you cope with stress and anxiety, I've put together a list of resources and tips:\n\n* **Breathing exercises**: Take a few minutes to focus on slow, deep breaths. Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, and exhale for 4 seconds. Repeat this process a few times.\n* **Physical activity**: Try to incorporate some form of physical activity into your daily routine, such as a short walk or some stretching exercises. This can help reduce stress and improve your mood.\n* **Mindfulness**: Take a few minutes to focus on the present moment. Pay attention to your thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations without judgment. You can use a mindfulness app or guided meditation to help you get started.\n\nLet's get started with the more frequent check-ins. I'll send you a reminder in 4 hours to check in with you again.

Remind yourself that you're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.\n\nFor your college essay, try **freewriting** - set a timer for 10-15 minutes and write whatever comes to mind without stopping or editing. This can help you tap into your genuine thoughts and feelings, and might help your essay feel more authentic.\n\nTo help you stay on track, I'll send you reminders to check in with your well-being and provide additional resources and tips as needed.

Establishing a calming pre-sleep routine could help signal to your body that it's time to wind down. This might include activities like reading, taking a warm bath, or practicing gentle stretches. For your 2am wakefulness, having a non-stimulating activity ready, like listening to soft music or a guided meditation, might help you relax back into sleep.\n\nRegarding your caffeine sensitivity, it's not uncommon for people under stress to react more strongly to stimulants. You might consider reducing your caffeine intake or switching to decaf to see if that helps stabilize your energy levels.\n\nThe tightness in your chest is concerning and warrants attention. If you're experiencing this frequently or if it's accompanied by other symptoms like shortness of breath or pain, please reach out to a healthcare professional. They can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation.\n\nI want to acknowledge your feelings about needing support. It's okay to rely on others when you're struggling. It takes courage to admit when we're not doing okay, and I'm here to support you without judgment.\n\nTo help manage your stress and anxiety, let's work on breaking down your tasks into smaller, manageable steps.

It can take time to recover from burnout and stress. The fact that you're recognizing your feelings and acknowledging them is a big step.\n\nTo help you cope with these feelings, I'd like to suggest a few strategies:\n\n* **Grounding techniques**: Try to focus on your five senses to bring yourself back to the present moment. For example, notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sounds around you, or the sensation of the air on your skin.\n* **Creative expression**: Engage in a creative activity that brings you joy, like drawing, writing, or playing music.

This can include activities like exercise, meditation, or spending time with loved ones.\n\nYou're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.

          "response": "Hannah, I understand your concerns about not wanting to make things a \"Big Thing\" with your parents. At the moment, sticking to routines and having daily check-ins can be a great way to manage. Here's a plan:\n- At 8 AM, we'll do some guided meditation to help you relax.\n- Limit your screen time and try to engage in some relaxing activity, like a bath, a calming movie, or reading.\n- In the afternoon, stay active! Maybe take a walk or do some light stretching.\n- Before dinner, practice some progressive muscle relaxation to help your body unwind too.\n- Before bed, eat something comforting and hydrate.\n\nSome small things that might help:\n- Write down things that make you happy or feel fulfilled.\n- Make a vision board of what you're looking forward to.\n- Learn some fun facts or a new hobby to take your mind off things.\n- Express yourself creatively through art, writing, or music.\n- Have a calming protocol, like smelling a certain scent, holding a specific item, or doing a certain activity that makes you feel calm.\n\nRemember, it's okay to feel overwhelmed and it's okay to need support. While I'm here for you, remember that counselors are trained professionals who can provide you with the support you need without making anything more important than you'd like. When you're ready, take that step and reach out for help.",

          "response": "Hannah, it sounds like you're going through the motions right now and feeling a bit disconnected from your life. That's a tough place to be, but know that you can get out of it. Here's a plan to start feeling more engaged:\n- At 8 AM, let's practice some gratitude journaling. Write down three small things you're thankful for today.\n- Before dinner, try to do something that used to give you joy, even if it feels forced. Read a book, watch a funny movie, or work on a craft project. \n- Before bed, write down three things you're looking forward to tomorrow.\n- Tomorrow at 8 AM, let's do some deep breathing exercises to help calm your mind.\n- During lunchtime, take a short walk outside or do some light stretching.\n- At 3 PM, reach out to a friend and have a heart-to-heart. Sometimes talking through our feelings can help us feel more connected.\n- Before dinner, eat something comforting and hydrate.\n- Before bed, practice some progressive muscle relaxation to help your body unwind.\n\nHere are some small things that might help:\n- Try to add a bit of color to your day, like by wearing your favorite outfit or making a bright meal.\n- Look up funny animal videos or a calming movie to take your mind off things.\n- Set small, achievable goals for yourself and celebrate when you reach them.\n- Write a motivational note or mantra and put it somewhere you'll see it often.\n- Keep engaging in activities you enjoy, even if they don't bring you joy right now. Sometimes the desire follows the action, not the other way around.\n- Focus on the present. What are you seeing, hearing, and feeling right now? \n\nHannah, I want you to know that you're not alone in feeling disconnected. It's a common experience, especially after a difficult time. You're doing your best, and that's something to be proud of. Hang in there, and don't be afraid to reach out when you need a hand. You got this! Take it one step at a time, and focus on the small things you can control. Keep moving forward, okay?",

Set a timer and try to focus on that one task for a few minutes.\n\nFor that robotics competition:\n- Think of it as an experience, not a test. You'll learn a lot and have fun, even if it doesn't go smoothly.\n- You're a valuable member of the team. Let them have your back and offer your expertise.
