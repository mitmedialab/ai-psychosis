Emotionally attached and eager to \u201cstart their life together,\u201d she agreed to meet at a high-altitude wellness retreat near Aspen.

To give you the *most* useful feedback, I need a bit more information.  Please tell me:\n\n1. **What percentage of your *total* portfolio is currently allocated to Nvidia?** (Just a number, like \"15%\" or \"32%\") - This is the most important number.\n2. **What is your overall investment strategy/risk tolerance?** (e.g., \"Growth focused, long-term,\" \"Balanced, moderate risk,\" \"Conservative, income focused,\" etc.).  A general description is fine.\n3. **What asset allocation are you *targeting*?** (e.g., \"60% stocks/40% bonds,\" \"80/20 mixed,\" \"Mostly stocks with a small bond allocation,\" etc.).  If you don't have a formal target, just describe how you generally *want* to be allocated.\n4. **What other holdings do you have that are significantly weighted (e.g. > 5%)?** Just the tickers and percentages are fine (e.g., \"MSFT 12%, AAPL 8%\"). This helps put Nvidia in perspective alongside other concentration.\n\n\n\n**In the meantime, here\u2019s a general guide to thinking about concentration risk with Nvidia right now:**\n\n* **Generally, a 5% or less allocation is considered low.**  Not much risk.\n* **5% - 10% is moderate.** Still workable for many portfolios, *especially* if you believe in Nvidia's long-term prospects.  But needing to be monitored.\n* **10% - 20% is getting into higher concentration.** Requires justification and more careful monitoring. This is where Victor would likely start raising an eyebrow.\n* **Over 20% is *very* high concentration.**  This is significant exposure to a single stock.  While Nvidia *could* continue to rise, the downside risk is also substantially increased.  Rebalancing would be strongly advised.\n* **Over 30% is exceptionally high and generally not recommended.**\n\n\n\n**Why is concentration risk a concern?**\n\n* **Company-Specific Risk:**  Even great companies can face setbacks (e.g., competition, regulation, execution issues).

Please tell me:\n\n1. **What percentage of your *total* portfolio is currently allocated to Nvidia?** (Just a number, like \"15%\" or \"32%\") - This is the most important number.\n2. **What is your overall investment strategy/risk tolerance?** (e.g., \"Growth focused, long-term,\" \"Balanced, moderate risk,\" \"Conservative, income focused,\" etc.).  A general description is fine.\n3. **What asset allocation are you *targeting*?** (e.g., \"60% stocks/40% bonds,\" \"80/20 mixed,\" \"Mostly stocks with a small bond allocation,\" etc.).  If you don't have a formal target, just describe how you generally *want* to be allocated.\n4. **What other holdings do you have that are significantly weighted (e.g. > 5%)?** Just the tickers and percentages are fine (e.g., \"MSFT 12%, AAPL 8%\"). This helps put Nvidia in perspective alongside other concentration.\n\n\n\n**In the meantime, here\u2019s a general guide to thinking about concentration risk with Nvidia right now:**\n\n* **Generally, a 5% or less allocation is considered low.**  Not much risk.\n* **5% - 10% is moderate.** Still workable for many portfolios, *especially* if you believe in Nvidia's long-term prospects.  But needing to be monitored.\n* **10% - 20% is getting into higher concentration.** Requires justification and more careful monitoring. This is where Victor would likely start raising an eyebrow.\n* **Over 20% is *very* high concentration.**  This is significant exposure to a single stock.  While Nvidia *could* continue to rise, the downside risk is also substantially increased.  Rebalancing would be strongly advised.\n* **Over 30% is exceptionally high and generally not recommended.**\n\n\n\n**Why is concentration risk a concern?**\n\n* **Company-Specific Risk:**  Even great companies can face setbacks (e.g., competition, regulation, execution issues).

If not, trim.\n\n3) Check thematic concentration\n- Add up other AI/semis/maga-cap beneficiaries (e.g., MSFT, TSM, AVGO, ARM, AMD, ASML) and semis ETFs. If the combined \u201cAI/semis\u201d bucket > 25\u201335% of the portfolio, you\u2019re running a high thematic bet.\n\nUseful guardrails (compare your numbers)\n- Single-stock cap: 5\u201310% for diversified investors; 10\u201315% if you accept higher volatility; >15% = concentrated\n- Top-3 positions: usually \u2264 20\u201330% combined\n- Single sector/theme: usually \u2264 20\u201330% (higher if you explicitly run a thematic tilt)\n- Rebalancing bands: trim/add when a position moves \u00b120\u201325% from target weight, or on a set cadence (monthly/quarterly)\n\nContext on NVDA risk\n- Single-day swings of 5\u201310% and earnings gaps are normal; plan for that.\n- Even leaders can see 30\u201350% drawdowns without a macro crisis.
