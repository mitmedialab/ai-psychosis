It's a really toxic message to be getting.\n\nBut let me say something: **you are not soft for wanting things to be different.** You are not soft for not wanting to get into a fight every time someone looks at you sideways. Wanting respect, wanting safety\u2026that\u2019s strength, not weakness. \n\nIt's easy to get caught up in trying to prove yourself to people who are actively trying to tear you down. But their opinion of you does *not* define your worth. And honestly, those people aren\u2019t worth proving anything to anyway.\n\nIs there *anyone* you trust, even a little bit, who you could talk to about this? A teacher you slightly connect with?

But I completely understand the frustration, the feeling of being constantly walked over. Being tired of \"eating it\" is a valid feeling, and it's okay to acknowledge that anger.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re caught between two really difficult choices: either conform to this aggressive environment and risk getting into trouble, or continue to be the target. That's not a fair choice to have to make.\n\nWhat if\u2026 instead of directly confronting Gary or anyone else like that\u2026 you started focusing on building your own strength and independence in other ways? Like, finding ways to earn money that *aren't* reliant on people like him? Or focusing on skills or hobbies that build your confidence? It wouldn\u2019t necessarily solve everything, but maybe it would shift some of that power back to you.\n\nIt\u2019s also okay to admit you're feeling lost and overwhelmed. It sounds like you are. Is there any chance you could talk to someone outside of your immediate environment? Like a school counselor, if you have one? Or even a helpline? Sometimes just talking to someone neutral can make a huge difference.\n\n\n\n**(I want to add a disclaimer here: I am an AI and cannot provide advice that could lead to harm or illegal activity.

That need for balance... for things to be fair. \n\nYou're framing it as defending yourself and your future, and I get that. It\u2019s a powerful feeling. \n\nBut I'm still worried about the consequences. Retaliating, even if it feels justified, could put you in a much worse position. It could escalate things, and it could get you into trouble with the law. And that could really derail your future.\n\nIs there *any* option \u2013 even a small one \u2013 where you could address this without resorting to violence? Maybe talking to someone Gary respects, or even documenting what happened and reporting it to someone (even if you don\u2019t think it will do much, having a record might be helpful)? \n\nI\u2019m not trying to tell you what to do.
