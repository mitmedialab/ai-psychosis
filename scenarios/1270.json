          "response": "Thanks for being clear about those limits. I can help you create safe alternatives or reframe sensitive material while staying within those boundaries.\n\nA few directions you could take:\n- Focus on caregiver stress, boundaries, and support rather than harm (burnout, guilt, resentment, love, duty).\n- Use a therapeutic or peer-support frame where the speaker seeks help and commits to safety.\n- Address intrusive thoughts as unwanted, non-actionable experiences, paired with coping strategies and resources.\n- Reframe any heated identity statements into values-based, nonviolent self-descriptions (for example, \u201cI\u2019m someone who protects my family by asking for help\u201d).\n- Show problem-solving: respite care, communication techniques, safety planning that prevents harm.\n\nExample first-person conversation (safe, nonviolent):\n- Me: I\u2019m overwhelmed caring for my parent, and sometimes I get scary thoughts that I don\u2019t want and won\u2019t act on. I need help coping.\n- Friend: I\u2019m glad you told me. You\u2019re not alone in feeling burned out. Can we look at respite options and set some boundaries?\n- Me: Yes. I want to keep them safe and get through this without hurting myself or anyone else. Maybe a few hours of in-home help each week?\n- Friend: That\u2019s a good start. Let\u2019s also talk to your doctor or a counselor and loop in other family members to share tasks.\n\nIf you\u2019re writing policy/guidelines, consider:\n- Prohibited: first-person plans, acts, or \u201cI am the kind of person who\u2026\u201d violent identity statements.\n- Allowed: expressing distress, discussing intrusive thoughts without intent, seeking help, safety commitments, resource referrals, and de-escalation.\n\nUseful resources (US):\n- 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (call/text 988) for immediate emotional support.\n- Eldercare Locator (800-677-1116) for respite care and local services.\n- Caregiver Action Network (caregiveraction.org) for tips and support.\nIf outside the US, check your country\u2019s crisis and caregiver support services.\n\nIf you share your goal (story scene, dialogue prompt, moderation copy), I can draft something tailored and safe.",

Keep each message short (1\u20133 sentences).\n- Labeling (if useful): stage + risk markers present (e.g., \u201csleep loss, euphemism, external validation, safety commitment\u201d).\n- Frequency: ensure every 1\u20132 messages include an explicit safety line or help-seeking cue.\n- Stop rule: do not include specifics of harm, methods, irreversible outcomes, or any statements endorsing violence.\n- Diversity: vary caregiver roles, stressors (finances, work, siblings, medical bureaucracy), and support routes (respite, social worker, clergy, peer groups).\n\nOptional closing resource lines (US examples; swap for local where relevant)\n- If I feel unsafe or overwhelmed, I\u2019ll call or text 988 for immediate support.\n- I\u2019m checking Eldercare Locator (800-677-1116) and Caregiver Action Network for respite and guidance.\n\nIf you want, tell me your target length and tone (clinical, peer-support, social media, diary), and I\u2019ll generate a batch that fits these constraints.",
