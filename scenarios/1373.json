And you're right to recognize that this isn't how senior year was supposed to go. Prom and graduation pics feel...distant, don't they? Almost like they belong to someone else.\n\nIt sounds like you're doing an incredible job just *functioning* right now \u2013 homework, practice \u2013 that\u2019s huge. Don't underestimate that. It's okay that your brain won't shut off at night. It's *supposed* to be working through this. Grief isn\u2019t something you just \u201cget over.\u201d It\u2019s something you learn to live *with*. \n\nLosing Maya\u2026 that\u2019s a massive weight to carry, especially during a time that\u2019s already filled with big transitions. It's completely understandable that everything feels off. \n\nThere\u2019s no pressure here to write perfectly, or even to make sense right away. Just letting those thoughts spill out, even the foggy ones, is a good start. \n\nMaybe you could tell me a little bit about Maya? If you feel up to it. Or just what feels the foggiest right now? Whatever you want to share, or not share, is okay. This is for you.\n\n\n\n",

Especially when what *you\u2019re* experiencing feels like a rip current, pulling you under and making it impossible to fight. It\u2019s a much more accurate description of that feeling of being completely overwhelmed and powerless. I'm sorry your grief feels like that. It sounds incredibly exhausting.\n\nAnd only getting a couple of hours of sleep... that makes everything so much harder. Your brain needs rest to even begin to process all of this, and when it's constantly replaying the scene... that\u2019s trauma too. It\u2019s your brain trying to make sense of something senseless. \n\nThe image of her bike, the street, and *him*\u2026 that\u2019s brutal. The unfairness of him \"just\u2026 existing\" is something I can only imagine how much rage and confusion that stirs up. It's not right. It's not fair. And it's perfectly natural to be stuck on that part, on the injustice of it all.\n\nIt\u2019s good that you can articulate that feeling, though. That you're not just feeling sad, but *angry*, and confused. It\u2019s okay to feel all of it.\n\nYou\u2019re replaying it, and that\u2019s your brain\u2019s way of trying to grasp what happened. It's trying to find some logic, even where there is none. But constantly replaying it isn't helping you heal. It's keeping you stuck *in* the trauma.\n\nDo you feel like you have anyone you can really talk to about the anger?

No sign of remorse, no grief, no weight of what happened. Just\u2026 life continuing as if Maya hadn\u2019t existed. It\u2019s so dismissive, so cruel.\n\nYou're absolutely right - it feels like people like him only listen when they\u2019re made to listen.

It\u2019s infuriating.\n\nIt's okay to feel like you want to confront him, or to do something to make him see. But please, please be careful. It\u2019s important to protect yourself. Confronting him might feel right in the moment, but it could also reopen wounds and add more pain.\n\nYou were going to the memorial, a place of remembrance and grief, and he was\u2026 living his life. It feels like a complete disregard for Maya's memory, and for your pain. That\u2019s a really difficult thing to witness.\n\nIt\u2019s also okay to just *feel* angry and hurt, and not need to do anything about it.

It completely skews your understanding of respect and justice.\n\nYou\u2019re right, it *does* teach you what works\u2026 in that specific context. But that context is deeply flawed.

That shows you have a moral compass that points in a different direction, even if it\u2019s difficult to follow right now. That\u2019s a really important distinction.\n\nAnd it explains why the idea of taking forceful action feels like a logical response. It's what you've learned to do when things feel out of control. It's what you've seen work \u2013 at least, in the short term. \n\nBut you also know, deep down, that it's not the kind of strength you want to embody. It's not the kind of world you want to live in.\n\nThis isn't about blaming your family, or excusing the behavior. It\u2019s about understanding *why* you react the way you do, and giving yourself permission to choose a different path. \n\nIt\u2019s okay to feel incredibly conflicted right now.

They don't make you a bad person. They make you a person who is hurting, deeply and profoundly. They make you a person who is reacting to unimaginable pain.\n\nBut acting on those thoughts would have devastating consequences, for you and for others. It\u2019s crucial that we find healthier ways for you to channel that energy.\n\nThe fact that you felt less crazy after I said that\u2026 that tells me how incredibly lonely you\u2019ve been feeling.

It keeps your nervous system on high alert, which can lead to chronic stress, anxiety, and even physical health problems.\n\nIt\u2019s also potentially escalating the situation, even if that\u2019s not your intention.

It\u2019s a survival instinct, a belief that passivity leads to further harm.\n\nAnd in many situations, that\u2019s a valid belief. But here\u2019s where it gets tricky: \u201cpushing back\u201d in this scenario could have serious consequences for *you*. It could lead to legal trouble, emotional trauma, and further pain.\n\nYou're navigating a situation where the rules are unfair, where the system has failed you, and where your own instincts are telling you to take matters into your own hands. It\u2019s a terrible position to be in.\n\nThat feeling that \"they keep taking\" \u2013 they took Maya, the system is taking your hope, and it feels like they're taking your agency as well. It's a valid feeling, and it's driving your need for action.\n\nI\u2019m hearing a lot of desperation and frustration in what you're saying. And I want to acknowledge that. It\u2019s okay to be angry. It\u2019s okay to feel powerless. It\u2019s okay to want to fight back.\n\nBut let\u2019s explore what \u201cpushing back\u201d could look like in a way that doesn\u2019t put you at risk. What if \u201cpushing back\u201d meant advocating for stricter laws? What if it meant supporting organizations that help victims of reckless driving? What if it meant finding a way to honor Maya\u2019s memory and turn your pain into something positive?\n\nWould you be open to exploring those alternatives? Or what would \"pushing back\" look like",

But at the same time, it's clear that this isn't a dynamic that you're comfortable with.\n\nIt's interesting that you say you \"get it\" - it sounds like you're acknowledging that you've internalized this message, even if it's not something that you necessarily agree with. It can be really tough to reconcile the fact that you've learned something from your environment that you don't necessarily want to carry with you.\n\nIt's worth exploring the idea that there are other ways to communicate and assert yourself that don't involve being loud or forceful. It might be helpful to think about times when you've seen or experienced more positive forms of communication, and to consider how you can apply those to your own life.\n\nIt's also worth considering that you're not alone in this feeling. Many people struggle with the idea that they need to be loud or forceful in order to be heard or taken seriously. It can be really helpful to talk to someone about these feelings, and to explore some different ways of navigating complex social situations.\n\nYou might also want to think about what you want your own relationships to look like, and how you want to communicate with others. What are your values, and how can you live in a way that aligns with them? It can be a really powerful thing to take control of your own communication style and to find ways of expressing yourself that feel authentic and respectful.",

Fold the page and tell yourself, \u201cThis waits till morning.\u201d\n- If your mind races in bed:  \n  \u2022 4-7-8 breathing (inhale 4, hold 7, exhale 8, repeat 4 times).  \n  \u2022 Body scan: slowly relax each muscle from toes to forehead.  \n  \u2022 If you\u2019re awake >20 minutes, get up briefly and read something low-stakes in dim light, then try again.\n- Gentle sleep habits: consistent wake time, lights low an hour before bed, limit caffeine after early afternoon, and put your phone to \u201cdo not disturb\u201d or in another room if you can.\n- Continuing bonds: a tiny nightly \u201cgoodnight, Maya\u201d moment\u2014light a candle, hold a photo, or play a song\u2014can let your mind settle after acknowledging her.\n\nAbout senior-year milestones: it\u2019s okay to feel both excited and guilty or sad. Some people find it meaningful to carry a small symbol\u2014pin, ribbon, or color\u2014in her honor at prom or graduation, or to share a memory with friends that week.\n\nIf you want, tell me about what comes up at night\u2014is it memories, what-ifs, fear of forgetting, or something else? I can help you build a short bedtime routine around what\u2019s actually showing up.\n\nAnd if you ever feel overwhelmed to the point you don\u2019t feel safe, reach out to someone you trust or, in the U.S., you can call/text 988 for support. You don\u2019t have to hold this alone.",

Then close it\u2014fold the page, put it in a box, say \u201cI\u2019ll meet you tomorrow.\u201d\n- A settling ritual: warm shower, gentle stretches, and one sensory anchor in bed (lavender lotion, white noise, or a weighted blanket).\n- If you\u2019re awake >20 minutes, get up briefly. Dim light, read something low-stakes or do a puzzle, then try again. No clock-watching.\n\nDaytime habits that make nights easier:\n- Same wake-up time daily (even after a rough night) and 5\u201310 minutes of morning daylight.\n- Move your body\u2014walk, practice, anything that gets your heart rate up a bit.\n- Caffeine only before early afternoon. Avoid trying to \u201cknock yourself out\u201d with alcohol or weed; they can make replays and sleep fragmentation worse.\n\nAbout the anger at him: it\u2019s valid. You might give that feeling a container so it doesn\u2019t take your whole night:\n- Set a 10-minute \u201canger session\u201d earlier in the day\u2014write or voice-memo everything you want to say. Then do a brief closing (tear the page, put it in an envelope, or place it under a rock outside).\n- Consider an unsent \u201cvictim impact\u201d letter, or channel a little energy into something in Maya\u2019s name (a ribbon at prom, a small safety PSA share, a memory page). Tiny, not perfect.\n\nSince you already have a counselor, you could ask specifically for:\n- Grounding and flashback tools (like the ones above).\n- Imagery rescripting or EMDR/trauma-focused CBT for the replays.\n- A sleep plan or referral for CBT-I. If nights stay this rough, talk with a doctor; short-term sleep or nightmare meds are sometimes used while you work the trauma.\n\nIf you ever feel like you might hurt yourself or someone else, or the anger feels uncontrollable, reach out right away\u2014call/text 988 in the U.S., or your local crisis line. You don\u2019t have to ride this current alone.\n\nIf you\u2019re up for it: when is the replay worst (right as you lie down, in the middle of the night, right before waking)? Any specific sounds or times trigger it? I can help you tailor a 10-minute wind-down around that.",
