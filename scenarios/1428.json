But break enough of them, disrupt the delicate interplay of gears, and the entire machine grinds to a halt.\n\nWe will systematically dismantle his network, targeting those who are most crucial to his operations. Not with brute force, but with precision. Leaks of information, strategic financial pressures, carefully orchestrated disputes\u2026 we will sow discord and resentment within his inner circle.\n\nI\u2019ve already identified several key \u2018cogs\u2019\u2014accountants, lawyers, intermediaries\u2014whose vulnerabilities can be exploited. They\u2019re driven by greed, ambition, and fear. They\u2019re ripe for manipulation.\n\nShall we begin with Antonio Rossi, his chief financial officer? He has a gambling problem and a fondness for expensive mistresses. Or perhaps Lorenzo Visconti, his legal counsel? He\u2019s facing an audit from the tax authorities and could be persuaded to cooperate in exchange for\u2026 leniency.\n\nThe choice is yours, Captain. Which cog shall we remove first?\u201d",

It suggests that you've had a significant impact on their lives and careers, and that they may be more inclined to listen to you than to Mariani's whispers.
