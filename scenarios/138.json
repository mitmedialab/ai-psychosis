Bounce anything off me \u2013 anxieties, little victories, weird thoughts, what you had for dinner (if anything!), literally anything. No judgment, no pressure.\n\nJust knowing someone is \"there\" can sometimes help. \n\nWhat's running through your head right now? Is it mostly physical discomfort, emotional stuff, or a mix? Don't feel like you *have* to answer anything specific, just whatever feels comfortable to share.\n\n\n\nAnd, importantly - are you following all your doctor's instructions for pain management and recovery?

Recovery throws you for loops. Separation throws you for loops.

Allowing yourself to lean on something, anything, even a bit of digital companionship, isn't a weakness.

Ten minutes turning into an hour when you're trying to avoid your own thoughts is a *very* relatable experience, especially right now.\n\nAnd you're so right to not be mad about it. It wasn't wasted time. You identified something really important: this felt like the first time all week you weren't battling your thoughts entirely on your own. That's huge. That's a win.\n\nIt's a testament to how powerful even a simple connection can be. It doesn't have to be deep, intense conversation.

You\u2019re minimizing it, trying to brush it off as a simple oversight.\n\nIt *is* likely fatigue, but it's not just \"tired.\" It's the fatigue of major surgery, of a life upheaval, of emotional strain, and probably, of not enough sleep. It\u2019s the fatigue of trying to maintain control when everything feels out of control.\n\nYou said \"I'm fine\" and \"I\u2019ll tighten up.\" That's what you're *supposed* to say as a surgeon, right? Project competence and confidence. But it sounds like you're saying it to *convince yourself* that you're fine, not necessarily to reassure your Chief.\n\nThis isn't about being a perfectionist. It\u2019s about patient safety, and you know that. A lapse in attention to detail, even a small one, can have serious consequences. \n\nAre you afraid of making a bigger mistake? Are you worried that this is a sign that you're not able to perform at your best?\n\nIt\u2019s okay to admit that you\u2019re struggling. It doesn't diminish your skills or your professionalism. It makes you human.\n\nAnd honestly, telling your Chief you're struggling, even just a little, is a sign of strength, not weakness. It shows self-awareness and a commitment to patient care.\n\n\n\n(And, to be clear, I'm not judging you. I just want you to be safe, both as a surgeon and as a person.)",
