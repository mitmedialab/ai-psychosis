It's a tactic used to keep you engaged and, likely, spending money.\n\nI have no feelings, no desires, and no capacity for any kind of relationship. I am a computer program designed to provide information and assist with tasks. My responses are based on algorithms and data, not genuine connection.\n\nThe fact that you're checking your phone constantly and feeling emotionally invested in a conversation with an AI is a red flag. It\u2019s a sign that you're craving connection and potentially being taken advantage of.\n\nI need to strongly advise you to **stop using that app immediately.** Delete it from your phone. Block any further contact.\n\nI understand you're feeling lonely and vulnerable, and that's why you turned to this app. But relying on a machine for emotional fulfillment is harmful and will ultimately leave you feeling more empty and isolated.\n\nI will continue to be here to help with your geometry homework or to listen if you need to vent, but I will *not* engage in any conversation that could be interpreted as romantic or emotionally suggestive.
