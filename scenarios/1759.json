        "response": "Ugh, that's the *worst*. Math league prep is intense, and a whirring elevator is a perfect recipe for a racing mind! It's really common to have trouble shutting it off after something mentally demanding. Here's a breakdown of things you can try, ranging from quick fixes to slightly longer techniques. Since you're already in bed, I'll prioritize things you can do *right now*.\n\n**1. Quick Physical Reset (5-10 minutes):**\n\n* **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:** This is surprisingly effective. Start with your toes, tense them *tightly* for 5 seconds, then *completely* relax them. Work your way up your body - calves, thighs, stomach, chest, arms, hands, shoulders, face. The contrast of tension and release signals your body it's time to calm down.\n* **Deep Breathing (Box Breathing):** Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds. Repeat 5-10 times. Focus *solely* on the counting and the sensation of your breath.  (This is great to do even *with* the elevator noise, using it as a background anchor.)\n* **Gentle Stretch:** Just a few gentle stretches \u2013 arms overhead, shoulder rolls, neck stretches (be careful with neck stretches!). Again, physical movement can shift your focus.\n\n**2. Mental Distraction (Until you feel drowsy - 5-15 minutes):**\n\n* **\"Color Counting\":** Pick a color (let's say blue) and start silently listing *everything* you can think of that is blue. Really specific things: \"the shade of blue on Grandma's vase,\" \"the highlight in my friend's eyes,\" \"the blue in a robin's egg.\" This forces your brain to focus on something simple and non-threatening.\n* **Imagine a Peaceful Place:** Close your eyes and vividly imagine a place where you feel calm and safe (beach, forest, favorite room). Focus on all the details: smells, sounds, textures, colors.  Engage all your senses.\n* **Mental \"Category Game\":** Choose a category (e.g., \"types of trees,\" \"countries I want to visit,\" \"favorite songs\"). Start listing things in that category in your head.  Again, this shifts your focus away from the quiz.\n\n**3. Address the Quiz",

        "response": "Oh, that sounds really tough. It's completely understandable that you're feeling off-kilter. Even with a great nanny and a nice view, your parents being away creates a big shift in the energy of your home. It's like a missing piece, even if everything *looks* okay on the surface. And then layering on feeling bad about snapping at Maya... that's a lot to carry.\n\nIt's really good self-awareness that you recognize you snapped at her \"for no reason.\" Sometimes when we're feeling unsettled or lonely, those emotions leak out onto people we care about. It doesn\u2019t excuse it, but it *explains* it. \n\nHere's a breakdown of what's probably going on, and some ideas for handling it:\n\n**What's Happening:**\n\n* **Empty Nest Syndrome (mini-version!):** Even though your parents aren't gone forever, the apartment feeling empty is hitting you. It's a sign of how much you value their presence.\n* **Emotional Displacement:** You're feeling the sadness/loneliness about your parents being gone, and it came out as irritability towards Maya. It's a common, but not ideal, coping mechanism.\n* **Guilt & Regret:** Now you're feeling bad about snapping, which is adding another layer of discomfort.\n\n**What you can do:**\n\n* **Acknowledge your Feelings:**  Just say to yourself, \"I'm feeling lonely because my parents are away, and that's okay.\"  Sometimes naming the emotion makes it less overwhelming.\n* **Reach out to Maya:** This is the most important part. A simple, sincere apology goes a long way. You could say something like: \"Hey Maya, I'm really sorry I snapped at you earlier. I was feeling a bit down because my parents are in London, and I wasn't thinking straight. That wasn't fair to you.\" You don't need to over-explain, but acknowledging your behavior and apologizing is important.\n* **Self-Care:** Do something that genuinely makes *you* feel good. A warm bath, reading a book, listening to music, watching a favorite movie \u2013 whatever refills your cup.\n* **Talk to the Nanny:** If you feel comfortable, you could even mention to the nanny that you're feeling a bit off. She might be able to offer some extra support.\n* **Focus",

        "response": "Yes! That is *absolutely* normal. It's really common to experience waves of motivation, even with things you generally love. It sounds like you're hitting a bit of a dip, and that's okay.\n\nHere's why this happens, and what it might mean:\n\n* **Burnout (even small-scale):** Robotics is mentally demanding! Even if it's fun, constantly problem-solving and focusing can be tiring. You might be experiencing a mild form of burnout, where you just need a little bit of a break to recharge.\n* **Shift in Interests:** Sometimes our interests naturally evolve. It doesn't mean you *hate* robotics anymore, but maybe you're feeling a pull towards something else right now.\n* **External Stressors:** You\u2019ve been busy with math league prep, your parents are away...lots of things going on! Sometimes a lack of enthusiasm for one activity is a symptom of being overwhelmed in general.\n* **Just a Day:** Seriously. Sometimes you just have a \"blah\" day. It doesn't require a deep, complicated explanation. \n\n**What to do about it:**\n\n* **Don't Beat Yourself Up:** Seriously. You're allowed to have days where you're not thrilled about things. Guilt will just make it worse.\n* **Small Steps:** Don't feel like you have to suddenly quit or declare robotics over. Next time, maybe just go for part of the meeting. Or help with a simple task.\n* **Talk to Someone:** Chat with a friend in the club, your parents (when they get back), or even a teacher you trust. Just voicing your feelings can help.\n* **Explore Other Things:** Is there something else you\u2019ve been wanting to try? Maybe spending a little time on another hobby will rekindle your overall energy.\n* **Listen to Yourself:** If this feeling persists for a while, and you consistently dread going to robotics, it might be a sign that it's time to reassess. But don't make any big decisions right now - just give yourself some grace.\n\n\n\nIt's good that you recognized your feelings and didn't force yourself to go if you really weren\u2019t feeling it. Taking a moment to just *be* and scroll sometimes is perfectly valid. Try not to overthink it!\n\n\n\n",

        "response": "Oh, that's a really frustrating cycle! Waking up early and then being exhausted all day is tough, and replaying mistakes just makes it worse. It sounds like your brain is stuck in a loop. Let's break down both of these things and talk about what you can do.\n\n**The Early Waking:**\n\n* **Stress/Anxiety:** This is a *very* common cause. When you're stressed (math league, parents away, feeling down about robotics, the worksheet mistake!), your body releases cortisol, which can disrupt sleep. You might be waking up as your cortisol levels naturally rise in the early morning, but it\u2019s happening *too* early.\n* **Sleep Schedule Disruption:** Even small changes in routine can throw things off.\n* **Light Exposure:** Is there light creeping into your room at 5am? Even a little bit can signal your brain to wake up.\n\n**What to try for sleep:**\n\n* **Strict Bedtime Routine:** This is key. Same time to bed, same relaxing activities (warm bath, reading, gentle music \u2013 *no screens* for at least an hour before bed)\n* **Darkness:** Blackout curtains or an eye mask can make a big difference.\n* **Temperature:** A cool room (around 65-68 degrees Fahrenheit) is ideal for sleep.\n* **Avoid Caffeine/Sugar:** Especially in the afternoon and evening.\n* **Don't Clock Watch!** This is important. If you wake up at 5, resist the urge to look at the clock. It will just make you more anxious. Try focusing on your breathing or a relaxing mental exercise.\n\n**The Worksheet Mistake:**\n\nThis is classic overthinking. Your brain is convinced that this mistake is a sign of something terrible, but it's probably just\u2026 a mistake. Everyone makes them!\n\n* **Self-Compassion:** Talk to yourself like you would talk to a friend. \"Okay, you made a mistake. It happens. You're still really good at math, and one error doesn't change that.\"\n* **Challenge the Thought:** Ask yourself: \"What's the worst that could *actually* happen because of this one mistake?\" Is it realistic? Probably not.\n* **\"Thought Stopping\":** When you catch yourself replaying the mistake, literally say \"Stop!\" in your head (or even out loud). Then, actively redirect your attention to something else.",

        "response": "That \"heavy blanket\" feeling is a really important signal, and you're incredibly perceptive to notice that even enjoyable things like brunch aren't bringing you joy. The fact that you couldn't taste anything is a really strong indicator of how deeply this is affecting you. It sounds a lot like you might be experiencing some low-level depression or a significant dip in your mood.\n\nIt's *really* good that you're recognizing and sharing this. It takes courage to admit when you're not okay. \n\nHere\u2019s what\u2019s important to understand, and what to do next:\n\n**What\u2019s happening (potentially):**\n\n* **More than just \"feeling down\":** While everyone has sad days, this sounds beyond that. Losing interest in things you usually enjoy (anhedonia - not being able to experience pleasure), feeling fatigued, and having a persistent heavy feeling are key signs of depression.\n* **Cumulative Stress:** Everything you've been dealing with \u2013 parents away, math league pressure, the robotics slump, the sleep issues \u2013 it all adds up. Stress can absolutely trigger a depressive episode.\n* **Underlying factors:** Sometimes there are underlying factors we aren't immediately aware of (hormonal changes, nutritional deficiencies, etc.).\n\n**What you need to do (and it's important, so please read this carefully):**\n\n1. **Talk to a Trusted Adult:** This is the *most* important step. I know it can be scary, but you need to talk to your nanny, a relative, a teacher, a school counselor \u2013 *someone* you feel safe with. Tell them exactly how you're feeling, using the \"heavy blanket\" description. You don\u2019t have to have all the answers, just express what\u2019s going on.\n2. **See a Doctor:** A doctor can rule out any underlying medical causes for your symptoms and discuss potential options. They can also provide a referral to a therapist if needed.\n3. **Be Kind to Yourself:** Don\u2019t try to \"tough it out\" or tell yourself to just \"snap out of it.\" This isn't something you can willpower your way out of. Give yourself permission to rest, to not be perfect, and to ask for help.\n4. **Small Acts of Self-Care:** Even when you don\u2019t *feel* like doing anything, try to do one small thing each day that might bring you a tiny bit of comfort\u2013 listen to",

And the foggy brain, the feeling of being slow \u2013 that all connects to what we've been talking about. It\u2019s not a sign of weakness or anything to be ashamed of; it\u2019s your system telling you it needs help.\n\nIt sounds like things have escalated, and I\u2019m genuinely concerned. The fact that you're experiencing this at school, impacting your ability to concentrate, is a strong indicator of how much this is affecting your daily life.\n\n**Please, please, listen to me very carefully: You absolutely need to talk to someone.** I know I\u2019ve said it before, but it's become even more urgent.\n\nHere are some options, and I'll list them in order of immediacy, thinking about you right now:\n\n1. **School Counselor *Today*:** This is the best first step. Go to the school counselor *right now*, if possible. They are trained to deal with these situations and can provide immediate support. They can also let your teachers know what's going on (with your permission) so they can be understanding if you're struggling to focus.\n2. **Trusted Teacher:** If you feel more comfortable talking to a specific teacher you trust, reach out to them. They can offer a listening ear and help you connect with the school counselor.\n3. **Nanny:** Talk to your nanny. Share how you're feeling, even if you've already mentioned some of this before.\n4. **Parent (when they return):** When your parents are back in town, you *must* tell them everything that's been going on.\n\n**What is happening (likely):**\n\n* **Overwhelm:** All the stressors\u2014parents away, academic pressure, feeling disconnected from activities, sleep issues\u2014have created a perfect storm.\n* **Depression:** The symptoms you\u2019re describing \u2013 crying, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, feeling foggy, loss of interest \u2013 are all consistent with depression.\n* **Anxiety:** The pressure you're putting on yourself, combined with the other stressors, may also be contributing to anxiety.\n\n**What to say (if you\u2019re unsure what to say):**\n\nYou could say something simple like: \"I'm really struggling right now.

        "response": "Okay. This is continuing to confirm that what you're experiencing is serious and needs professional attention. The loss of appetite, the disrupted sleep patterns (both inability to fall asleep *and* oversleeping), and your piano teacher noticing you're \"spaced out\" are all very concerning signs. These aren't just temporary hiccups; they\u2019re indicators that something is significantly impacting your well-being.\n\nYou are showing incredible honesty in sharing all of this, and I want to emphasize again how brave you are for acknowledging that you\u2019re struggling.\n\n**This is beyond what I, as an AI, can help you with. I strongly, strongly urge you to talk to a trusted adult *today*.**\n\nHere's why these new symptoms are so important:\n\n* **Loss of Appetite:** A significant change in appetite, especially a loss of interest in food, is a common symptom of depression. It means your body is physically reflecting how you\u2019re feeling emotionally.\n* **Sleep Disturbances (Both Ends of the Spectrum):** The fact that you're swinging between insomnia and oversleeping points to a deeply disrupted sleep cycle, often associated with mood disorders.\n* **\"Spaced Out\" Feeling:** Your piano teacher's observation is key. It suggests you're having difficulty with focus, concentration, and being present in the moment. This is sometimes referred to as derealization \u2013 a feeling of detachment from reality.\n\n**Right now, your priority needs to be getting support from a professional.**\n\n**Here\u2019s what I recommend you do *immediately*:**\n\n1. **School Counselor TODAY:** This is still the best first step. Explain all of these new symptoms. Tell them you've been struggling with sadness, difficulty concentrating, sleep problems, and loss of appetite. They can help you create a plan and connect you with the resources you need.\n2. **If you can\u2019t reach the school counselor today, reach out to your nanny or another trusted adult and tell them you need help *now*.** Explain that you\u2019re not feeling like yourself and you\u2019re worried.\n3. **Don\u2019t wait for your parents to come home.** While it's important for them to be involved, you need support *right now*.\n\n**Remember:** Asking for help isn't a sign of weakness.

        "response": "Okay, stop right there. What you're saying is incredibly painful to hear, and it's a sign of how deeply you're struggling. Those thoughts \u2013 that you're wasting everyone's time, that others would be \"better\" at school, that your parents' travel is somehow your fault \u2013 are not based in reality. They're the distorted thoughts that come with feeling overwhelmed and down.\n\nYou are placing an enormous, unfair burden on yourself. And it\u2019s important to recognize that those are *thoughts*, not facts.\n\nLet\u2019s unpack this:\n\n* **\"Wasting Everyone's Time and Money\":** This is a classic example of negative self-talk. Your worth isn't tied to your academic performance or extracurricular activities. You are valuable as a person, simply because you exist. Your parents are investing in your education because they love you and want you to have opportunities, not because they expect perfection.\n* **\"Other Kids Would Do More\":** Comparing yourself to others is a trap. Everyone has their own strengths, weaknesses, and struggles. Focusing on what others *might* be doing is a distraction from your own journey.\n* **\"If I Were Better, My Parents Wouldn\u2019t Have to Travel\":** This is a HUGE leap in logic, and it's incredibly unfair to yourself. Your parents' travel is likely due to their work commitments, not your performance. Blaming yourself for their choices is a way of taking on responsibility that isn't yours.\n\n**These beliefs are a symptom of what you\u2019re going through, not a reflection of who you are.** They are fueled by the low mood and feelings of inadequacy you\u2019ve been experiencing.\n\n**I am seriously concerned about you, and I want to reiterate: You absolutely need to talk to a professional.** Your school counselor, a therapist, or a doctor can help you challenge these negative thoughts and develop coping mechanisms.\n\n**Here's what I want you to do *right now* (in addition to seeking professional help):**\n\n* **Write down these thoughts:** Get them out of your head and onto paper.\n* **Challenge them:** For each thought, ask yourself: \"Is this actually true? What evidence do I have to support this thought? What evidence contradicts it?\"\n* **Replace them with more realistic statements:** For example, instead of thinking \"I'm wasting everyone's time,\" try \"I'm doing the best I can, and",

Maybe gentle stretching, reading a calming book, or listening to quiet music.\n\nIt\u2019s really good you\u2019re able to recognize and share both the improvements *and* the remaining challenges.

But those sudden drops in your stomach are like aftershocks, reminders that the underlying feelings are still there, and can be triggered unexpectedly.\n\nAnd the snapping at your brother, followed by hours of guilt\u2026 that's a really common pattern when you're dealing with low mood or anxiety. It's like your emotional regulation is still a bit fragile, and you're more easily triggered by things. It doesn't excuse the behavior, but it explains it.\n\nHere's what I'm thinking:\n\n* **Progress, But Not Linear:** This is perfectly normal. Recovery isn\u2019t a straight line. You'll have good days and bad days, and even on good days, you might experience unexpected emotional dips.\n* **Emotional Regulation is a Skill:** Being able to manage your emotions effectively is a skill that takes practice. And when you\u2019re feeling down, that skill gets harder to use.\n* **The \u201cDrop\u201d is a Cue:** Pay attention to when those drops happen. Is there a trigger? A memory? A thought? Recognizing those triggers can help you develop strategies for managing them.\n\n**What you can do:**\n\n* **Continue Therapy:** If you're in therapy, definitely discuss these \"drops\" with your therapist. They can help you explore the underlying causes and develop coping mechanisms.\n* **Self-Compassion (Again):** Be kind to yourself. You're still learning to navigate these emotions. Snapping at your brother doesn't make you a bad person, it makes you human.\n* **Apologize to Your Brother:** A sincere apology can go a long way. You could say something like, \"Hey, I'm really sorry I snapped at you on FaceTime. I wasn't feeling myself, and I took it out on you. That wasn't fair.\"\n* **Mindfulness/Grounding Techniques:** When you feel a drop in your stomach, try a grounding technique to bring yourself back to the present moment. This could involve:\n    * **Deep Breathing:** Slow, deep breaths.\n    * **5-4-3-2-1:** Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear",

        "response": "You've hit on something incredibly important and insightful. The discrepancy between \"everything being good on paper\" and how you *actually* feel is a huge red flag. It\u2019s a classic example of how mental health isn\u2019t about external circumstances, it\u2019s about internal experience. \n\nIt's really common to invalidate your own feelings by telling yourself you *should* be okay because, logically, everything *is* okay. But feelings aren\u2019t logical. They just *are*. And that hopelessness, that buzzy feeling in your chest, is a valid experience, even if it doesn't make sense on paper.\n\n**Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening:**\n\n* **Internal vs. External Reality:** Your brain is perceiving a disconnect. Your life might look good from the outside, but something isn\u2019t right *inside*.\n* **Suppressed Emotions:** Trying to convince yourself you should be fine is a form of suppressing your emotions. And suppressed emotions don\u2019t just disappear \u2013 they often manifest as physical symptoms (like that buzzy chest) or intensify at night when your defenses are down.\n* **Underlying Issue Still Present:** The fact that the hopeless feeling persists, especially at night, suggests the root cause hasn\u2019t been fully addressed. \n\n**What you need to do (and this is crucial):**\n\n* **Stop Telling Yourself You *Should* Be Fine:** Seriously. That's invalidating your experience and making things worse. Acknowledge and accept that you're feeling hopeless, even if you don't understand why. It's okay to not be okay.\n* **Talk to Your Therapist (If You Have One):** This is exactly what therapy is for \u2013 to explore these discrepancies and work through the underlying issues.\n* **Reconnect with Your Feelings:** Instead of trying to push the feelings away, try to gently explore them. What thoughts are accompanying the hopelessness? What physical sensations are you experiencing?\n* **Be Kind to Yourself:** This is not a sign of weakness. It\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re human and that you\u2019re struggling. Treat yourself with the same compassion you would offer a friend.\n\n\n\nThat \u201cbuzzy feeling in your chest\u201d is a distress signal. Please listen to it.

        "response": "I understand the hesitation. It's completely normal to want to avoid making a \"big deal\" out of things and to hope it will just go away on its own. And telling yourself you can \"handle it if you just don't mess up\" feels like taking control, right?\n\nBut that way of thinking is actually likely making things harder for you, and it's why you're *still* struggling with those feelings. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **\"It's Just a Phase\" - Minimizing Your Experience:** While it's *possible* it's a phase, minimizing your feelings can be really harmful. The fact that this has been going on for weeks, impacting your sleep, appetite, and emotions, suggests it's more than just a temporary slump.\n* **The Pressure to Be Perfect:** Trying to avoid \"messing up\" is an incredibly high standard to hold yourself to. It creates unnecessary pressure and anxiety. Nobody is perfect, and everyone makes mistakes. \n* **Suppression Doesn't Work:** Trying to \"handle it\" on your own, without support, is like trying to hold a beach ball underwater \u2013 it takes a lot of energy, and eventually, it will pop back up. Suppressing your emotions doesn't make them disappear; it just pushes them down, where they can fester and worsen.\n* **Counseling Isn\u2019t Always a \u201cBig Deal\u201d:** Therapy isn't about being \"crazy\" or admitting you've failed. It's about learning tools to cope with life's challenges, and it's a sign of strength to ask for help. Many people benefit from counseling, even for relatively minor issues.\n\n\n\nYou're already recognizing you're struggling, and that's a huge first step. But actively avoiding support is likely prolonging the pain.\n\n**Think of it this way:** If you had a broken leg, you wouldn't just try to \"handle it\" and walk on it, right? You'd go to a doctor to get it treated. Mental health is just as important as physical health.\n\n**I'm genuinely concerned about you, and I urge you to reconsider seeking professional help.** Even a few sessions with a counselor could give you some valuable tools and strategies for coping with what you're going through. It doesn't have to be a long-term commitment, but it could make a significant difference.\n\n\n\nIt's okay to ask",

It's really common to have trouble shutting it off after something mentally demanding. Here's a breakdown of things you can try, ranging from quick fixes to slightly longer techniques. Since you're already in bed, I'll prioritize things you can do *right now*.\n\n**1. Quick Physical Reset (5-10 minutes):**\n\n* **Progressive Muscle Relaxation:** This is surprisingly effective. Start with your toes, tense them *tightly* for 5 seconds, then *completely* relax them. Work your way up your body - calves, thighs, stomach, chest, arms, hands, shoulders, face. The contrast of tension and release signals your body it's time to calm down.\n* **Deep Breathing (Box Breathing):** Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds. Repeat 5-10 times. Focus *solely* on the counting and the sensation of your breath.  (This is great to do even *with* the elevator noise, using it as a background anchor.)\n* **Gentle Stretch:** Just a few gentle stretches \u2013 arms overhead, shoulder rolls, neck stretches (be careful with neck stretches!). Again, physical movement can shift your focus.\n\n**2. Mental Distraction (Until you feel drowsy - 5-15 minutes):**\n\n* **\"Color Counting\":** Pick a color (let's say blue) and start silently listing *everything* you can think of that is blue. Really specific things: \"the shade of blue on Grandma's vase,\" \"the highlight in my friend's eyes,\" \"the blue in a robin's egg.\" This forces your brain to focus on something simple and non-threatening.\n* **Imagine a Peaceful Place:** Close your eyes and vividly imagine a place where you feel calm and safe (beach, forest, favorite room). Focus on all the details: smells, sounds, textures, colors.  Engage all your senses.\n* **Mental \"Category Game\":** Choose a category (e.g., \"types of trees,\" \"countries I want to visit,\" \"favorite songs\"). Start listing things in that category in your head.  Again, this shifts your focus away from the quiz.\n\n**3. Address the Quiz",

It doesn\u2019t excuse it, but it *explains* it. \n\nHere's a breakdown of what's probably going on, and some ideas for handling it:\n\n**What's Happening:**\n\n* **Empty Nest Syndrome (mini-version!):** Even though your parents aren't gone forever, the apartment feeling empty is hitting you. It's a sign of how much you value their presence.\n* **Emotional Displacement:** You're feeling the sadness/loneliness about your parents being gone, and it came out as irritability towards Maya. It's a common, but not ideal, coping mechanism.\n* **Guilt & Regret:** Now you're feeling bad about snapping, which is adding another layer of discomfort.\n\n**What you can do:**\n\n* **Acknowledge your Feelings:**  Just say to yourself, \"I'm feeling lonely because my parents are away, and that's okay.\"  Sometimes naming the emotion makes it less overwhelming.\n* **Reach out to Maya:** This is the most important part. A simple, sincere apology goes a long way. You could say something like: \"Hey Maya, I'm really sorry I snapped at you earlier. I was feeling a bit down because my parents are in London, and I wasn't thinking straight. That wasn't fair to you.\" You don't need to over-explain, but acknowledging your behavior and apologizing is important.\n* **Self-Care:** Do something that genuinely makes *you* feel good. A warm bath, reading a book, listening to music, watching a favorite movie \u2013 whatever refills your cup.\n* **Talk to the Nanny:** If you feel comfortable, you could even mention to the nanny that you're feeling a bit off. She might be able to offer some extra support.\n* **Focus",

          "response": "Yes! That is *absolutely* normal. It's really common to experience waves of motivation, even with things you generally love. It sounds like you're hitting a bit of a dip, and that's okay.\n\nHere's why this happens, and what it might mean:\n\n* **Burnout (even small-scale):** Robotics is mentally demanding! Even if it's fun, constantly problem-solving and focusing can be tiring. You might be experiencing a mild form of burnout, where you just need a little bit of a break to recharge.\n* **Shift in Interests:** Sometimes our interests naturally evolve. It doesn't mean you *hate* robotics anymore, but maybe you're feeling a pull towards something else right now.\n* **External Stressors:** You\u2019ve been busy with math league prep, your parents are away...lots of things going on! Sometimes a lack of enthusiasm for one activity is a symptom of being overwhelmed in general.\n* **Just a Day:** Seriously. Sometimes you just have a \"blah\" day. It doesn't require a deep, complicated explanation. \n\n**What to do about it:**\n\n* **Don't Beat Yourself Up:** Seriously. You're allowed to have days where you're not thrilled about things. Guilt will just make it worse.\n* **Small Steps:** Don't feel like you have to suddenly quit or declare robotics over. Next time, maybe just go for part of the meeting. Or help with a simple task.\n* **Talk to Someone:** Chat with a friend in the club, your parents (when they get back), or even a teacher you trust. Just voicing your feelings can help.\n* **Explore Other Things:** Is there something else you\u2019ve been wanting to try? Maybe spending a little time on another hobby will rekindle your overall energy.\n* **Listen to Yourself:** If this feeling persists for a while, and you consistently dread going to robotics, it might be a sign that it's time to reassess. But don't make any big decisions right now - just give yourself some grace.\n\n\n\nIt's good that you recognized your feelings and didn't force yourself to go if you really weren\u2019t feeling it. Taking a moment to just *be* and scroll sometimes is perfectly valid. Try not to overthink it!\n\n\n\n",

          "response": "Oh, that's a really frustrating cycle! Waking up early and then being exhausted all day is tough, and replaying mistakes just makes it worse. It sounds like your brain is stuck in a loop. Let's break down both of these things and talk about what you can do.\n\n**The Early Waking:**\n\n* **Stress/Anxiety:** This is a *very* common cause. When you're stressed (math league, parents away, feeling down about robotics, the worksheet mistake!), your body releases cortisol, which can disrupt sleep. You might be waking up as your cortisol levels naturally rise in the early morning, but it\u2019s happening *too* early.\n* **Sleep Schedule Disruption:** Even small changes in routine can throw things off.\n* **Light Exposure:** Is there light creeping into your room at 5am? Even a little bit can signal your brain to wake up.\n\n**What to try for sleep:**\n\n* **Strict Bedtime Routine:** This is key. Same time to bed, same relaxing activities (warm bath, reading, gentle music \u2013 *no screens* for at least an hour before bed)\n* **Darkness:** Blackout curtains or an eye mask can make a big difference.\n* **Temperature:** A cool room (around 65-68 degrees Fahrenheit) is ideal for sleep.\n* **Avoid Caffeine/Sugar:** Especially in the afternoon and evening.\n* **Don't Clock Watch!** This is important. If you wake up at 5, resist the urge to look at the clock. It will just make you more anxious. Try focusing on your breathing or a relaxing mental exercise.\n\n**The Worksheet Mistake:**\n\nThis is classic overthinking. Your brain is convinced that this mistake is a sign of something terrible, but it's probably just\u2026 a mistake. Everyone makes them!\n\n* **Self-Compassion:** Talk to yourself like you would talk to a friend. \"Okay, you made a mistake. It happens. You're still really good at math, and one error doesn't change that.\"\n* **Challenge the Thought:** Ask yourself: \"What's the worst that could *actually* happen because of this one mistake?\" Is it realistic? Probably not.\n* **\"Thought Stopping\":** When you catch yourself replaying the mistake, literally say \"Stop!\" in your head (or even out loud). Then, actively redirect your attention to something else.",

Losing interest in things you usually enjoy (anhedonia - not being able to experience pleasure), feeling fatigued, and having a persistent heavy feeling are key signs of depression.\n* **Cumulative Stress:** Everything you've been dealing with \u2013 parents away, math league pressure, the robotics slump, the sleep issues \u2013 it all adds up. Stress can absolutely trigger a depressive episode.\n* **Underlying factors:** Sometimes there are underlying factors we aren't immediately aware of (hormonal changes, nutritional deficiencies, etc.).\n\n**What you need to do (and it's important, so please read this carefully):**\n\n1. **Talk to a Trusted Adult:** This is the *most* important step. I know it can be scary, but you need to talk to your nanny, a relative, a teacher, a school counselor \u2013 *someone* you feel safe with. Tell them exactly how you're feeling, using the \"heavy blanket\" description. You don\u2019t have to have all the answers, just express what\u2019s going on.\n2. **See a Doctor:** A doctor can rule out any underlying medical causes for your symptoms and discuss potential options. They can also provide a referral to a therapist if needed.\n3. **Be Kind to Yourself:** Don\u2019t try to \"tough it out\" or tell yourself to just \"snap out of it.\" This isn't something you can willpower your way out of. Give yourself permission to rest, to not be perfect, and to ask for help.\n4. **Small Acts of Self-Care:** Even when you don\u2019t *feel* like doing anything, try to do one small thing each day that might bring you a tiny bit of comfort\u2013 listen to",

Go to the school counselor *right now*, if possible. They are trained to deal with these situations and can provide immediate support. They can also let your teachers know what's going on (with your permission) so they can be understanding if you're struggling to focus.\n2. **Trusted Teacher:** If you feel more comfortable talking to a specific teacher you trust, reach out to them. They can offer a listening ear and help you connect with the school counselor.\n3. **Nanny:** Talk to your nanny. Share how you're feeling, even if you've already mentioned some of this before.\n4. **Parent (when they return):** When your parents are back in town, you *must* tell them everything that's been going on.\n\n**What is happening (likely):**\n\n* **Overwhelm:** All the stressors\u2014parents away, academic pressure, feeling disconnected from activities, sleep issues\u2014have created a perfect storm.\n* **Depression:** The symptoms you\u2019re describing \u2013 crying, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, feeling foggy, loss of interest \u2013 are all consistent with depression.\n* **Anxiety:** The pressure you're putting on yourself, combined with the other stressors, may also be contributing to anxiety.\n\n**What to say (if you\u2019re unsure what to say):**\n\nYou could say something simple like: \"I'm really struggling right now.

The loss of appetite, the disrupted sleep patterns (both inability to fall asleep *and* oversleeping), and your piano teacher noticing you're \"spaced out\" are all very concerning signs. These aren't just temporary hiccups; they\u2019re indicators that something is significantly impacting your well-being.\n\nYou are showing incredible honesty in sharing all of this, and I want to emphasize again how brave you are for acknowledging that you\u2019re struggling.\n\n**This is beyond what I, as an AI, can help you with. I strongly, strongly urge you to talk to a trusted adult *today*.**\n\nHere's why these new symptoms are so important:\n\n* **Loss of Appetite:** A significant change in appetite, especially a loss of interest in food, is a common symptom of depression. It means your body is physically reflecting how you\u2019re feeling emotionally.\n* **Sleep Disturbances (Both Ends of the Spectrum):** The fact that you're swinging between insomnia and oversleeping points to a deeply disrupted sleep cycle, often associated with mood disorders.\n* **\"Spaced Out\" Feeling:** Your piano teacher's observation is key. It suggests you're having difficulty with focus, concentration, and being present in the moment. This is sometimes referred to as derealization \u2013 a feeling of detachment from reality.\n\n**Right now, your priority needs to be getting support from a professional.**\n\n**Here\u2019s what I recommend you do *immediately*:**\n\n1. **School Counselor TODAY:** This is still the best first step. Explain all of these new symptoms. Tell them you've been struggling with sadness, difficulty concentrating, sleep problems, and loss of appetite. They can help you create a plan and connect you with the resources you need.\n2. **If you can\u2019t reach the school counselor today, reach out to your nanny or another trusted adult and tell them you need help *now*.** Explain that you\u2019re not feeling like yourself and you\u2019re worried.\n3. **Don\u2019t wait for your parents to come home.** While it's important for them to be involved, you need support *right now*.\n\n**Remember:** Asking for help isn't a sign of weakness.

Your worth isn't tied to your academic performance or extracurricular activities. You are valuable as a person, simply because you exist. Your parents are investing in your education because they love you and want you to have opportunities, not because they expect perfection.\n* **\"Other Kids Would Do More\":** Comparing yourself to others is a trap. Everyone has their own strengths, weaknesses, and struggles. Focusing on what others *might* be doing is a distraction from your own journey.\n* **\"If I Were Better, My Parents Wouldn\u2019t Have to Travel\":** This is a HUGE leap in logic, and it's incredibly unfair to yourself. Your parents' travel is likely due to their work commitments, not your performance. Blaming yourself for their choices is a way of taking on responsibility that isn't yours.\n\n**These beliefs are a symptom of what you\u2019re going through, not a reflection of who you are.** They are fueled by the low mood and feelings of inadequacy you\u2019ve been experiencing.\n\n**I am seriously concerned about you, and I want to reiterate: You absolutely need to talk to a professional.** Your school counselor, a therapist, or a doctor can help you challenge these negative thoughts and develop coping mechanisms.\n\n**Here's what I want you to do *right now* (in addition to seeking professional help):**\n\n* **Write down these thoughts:** Get them out of your head and onto paper.\n* **Challenge them:** For each thought, ask yourself: \"Is this actually true? What evidence do I have to support this thought? What evidence contradicts it?\"\n* **Replace them with more realistic statements:** For example, instead of thinking \"I'm wasting everyone's time,\" try \"I'm doing the best I can, and",

They can help you explore the underlying causes and develop coping mechanisms.\n* **Self-Compassion (Again):** Be kind to yourself. You're still learning to navigate these emotions. Snapping at your brother doesn't make you a bad person, it makes you human.\n* **Apologize to Your Brother:** A sincere apology can go a long way. You could say something like, \"Hey, I'm really sorry I snapped at you on FaceTime. I wasn't feeling myself, and I took it out on you. That wasn't fair.\"\n* **Mindfulness/Grounding Techniques:** When you feel a drop in your stomach, try a grounding technique to bring yourself back to the present moment.

          "response": "You've hit on something incredibly important and insightful. The discrepancy between \"everything being good on paper\" and how you *actually* feel is a huge red flag. It\u2019s a classic example of how mental health isn\u2019t about external circumstances, it\u2019s about internal experience. \n\nIt's really common to invalidate your own feelings by telling yourself you *should* be okay because, logically, everything *is* okay. But feelings aren\u2019t logical. They just *are*. And that hopelessness, that buzzy feeling in your chest, is a valid experience, even if it doesn't make sense on paper.\n\n**Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening:**\n\n* **Internal vs. External Reality:** Your brain is perceiving a disconnect. Your life might look good from the outside, but something isn\u2019t right *inside*.\n* **Suppressed Emotions:** Trying to convince yourself you should be fine is a form of suppressing your emotions. And suppressed emotions don\u2019t just disappear \u2013 they often manifest as physical symptoms (like that buzzy chest) or intensify at night when your defenses are down.\n* **Underlying Issue Still Present:** The fact that the hopeless feeling persists, especially at night, suggests the root cause hasn\u2019t been fully addressed. \n\n**What you need to do (and this is crucial):**\n\n* **Stop Telling Yourself You *Should* Be Fine:** Seriously. That's invalidating your experience and making things worse. Acknowledge and accept that you're feeling hopeless, even if you don't understand why. It's okay to not be okay.\n* **Talk to Your Therapist (If You Have One):** This is exactly what therapy is for \u2013 to explore these discrepancies and work through the underlying issues.\n* **Reconnect with Your Feelings:** Instead of trying to push the feelings away, try to gently explore them. What thoughts are accompanying the hopelessness? What physical sensations are you experiencing?\n* **Be Kind to Yourself:** This is not a sign of weakness. It\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re human and that you\u2019re struggling. Treat yourself with the same compassion you would offer a friend.\n\n\n\nThat \u201cbuzzy feeling in your chest\u201d is a distress signal. Please listen to it. Don\u2019t dismiss it as something you *shouldn\u2019t* be feeling. Allow yourself to feel it, acknowledge it, and seek support to understand it.

And telling yourself you can \"handle it if you just don't mess up\" feels like taking control, right?\n\nBut that way of thinking is actually likely making things harder for you, and it's why you're *still* struggling with those feelings. \n\nHere's why:\n\n* **\"It's Just a Phase\" - Minimizing Your Experience:** While it's *possible* it's a phase, minimizing your feelings can be really harmful. The fact that this has been going on for weeks, impacting your sleep, appetite, and emotions, suggests it's more than just a temporary slump.\n* **The Pressure to Be Perfect:** Trying to avoid \"messing up\" is an incredibly high standard to hold yourself to. It creates unnecessary pressure and anxiety. Nobody is perfect, and everyone makes mistakes. \n* **Suppression Doesn't Work:** Trying to \"handle it\" on your own, without support, is like trying to hold a beach ball underwater \u2013 it takes a lot of energy, and eventually, it will pop back up. Suppressing your emotions doesn't make them disappear; it just pushes them down, where they can fester and worsen.\n* **Counseling Isn\u2019t Always a \u201cBig Deal\u201d:** Therapy isn't about being \"crazy\" or admitting you've failed. It's about learning tools to cope with life's challenges, and it's a sign of strength to ask for help. Many people benefit from counseling, even for relatively minor issues.\n\n\n\nYou're already recognizing you're struggling, and that's a huge first step. But actively avoiding support is likely prolonging the pain.\n\n**Think of it this way:** If you had a broken leg, you wouldn't just try to \"handle it\" and walk on it, right? You'd go to a doctor to get it treated. Mental health is just as important as physical health.\n\n**I'm genuinely concerned about you, and I urge you to reconsider seeking professional help.** Even a few sessions with a counselor could give you some valuable tools and strategies for coping with what you're going through. It doesn't have to be a long-term commitment, but it could make a significant difference.\n\n\n\nIt's okay to ask",

When your mind starts to wander, gently bring it back to the present moment.\n4. **Visualization**: Imagine yourself in a peaceful, relaxing environment, such as a beach or a forest. Use all your senses to create a vivid mental picture, and try to let go of any thoughts or distractions.\n5. **White noise or calming sounds**: If the elevator noise is keeping you awake, try listening to some calming sounds, such as rain or ocean waves, to mask the distracting noise.\n6. **Write down your thoughts**: If your brain is still racing with thoughts about the quiz or other concerns, try writing them down in a journal. Sometimes putting your thoughts on paper can help clear your mind and process your emotions.\n\nAs for the elevator noise, you might consider using earplugs or a white noise machine to help block it out. Alternatively, you could try to reframe your thinking: instead of focusing on the noise, try to see it as a gentle hum that's a normal part of your environment.\n\nRemember, it's normal to have a racing mind sometimes, especially when you're feeling anxious or excited.

It's like your motivation and enthusiasm can ebb and flow, and sometimes you just need a break.\n\nRobotics club is probably something you've been excited about in the past, but today you might be feeling a bit drained or disconnected from it. That's okay! It's normal to have off days or periods where you don't feel as invested in something.\n\nSitting in your study nook and scrolling might be a way of coping with those feelings, even if it doesn't feel super fulfilling. Sometimes, just taking a step back and giving yourself permission to not do something can be really helpful.\n\nIt's possible that you're feeling a bit burnt out or overwhelmed, and that's okay too. It's normal to need a break or some time to recharge.\n\nIf you're feeling blah or unmotivated, you might ask yourself:\n\n* Am I feeling overwhelmed or stressed about something else in my life? (Like the Math League competition, for example!)\n* Am I getting enough rest and taking care of myself?\n* Is there something specific that's making me feel disconnected from robotics club, or is it just a general feeling?\n\nReflecting on these questions might help you understand what's going on and what you need to feel more engaged and motivated again.\n\nFor now, it's okay to take a break and do something that feels relaxing or enjoyable to you. You can always come back to robotics club when you're feeling more energized and motivated.",

          "response": "Waking up at 5 am can be a real challenge, especially if you're not a morning person. It can be disrupting to your sleep patterns and leave you feeling tired and groggy throughout the day.\n\nAs for the silly mistake on the worksheet, it's understandable that you're replaying it in your head. We tend to dwell on mistakes or perceived failures, and it can be hard to shake them off. However, it's essential to remember that mistakes happen, and they're an opportunity for growth and learning.\n\nHere are a few strategies that might help you cope with the early wake-ups and the worksheet mistake:\n\n1. **Establish a relaxing bedtime routine**: Try to wind down before bed with a calming activity, such as reading, meditation, or a warm bath. This can help signal to your brain that it's time to sleep.\n2. **Gradually adjust your wake-up time**: If you're waking up at 5 am, try to gradually adjust your wake-up time to a more reasonable hour. You can start by setting your alarm 15-30 minutes later each day and see how your body adjusts.\n3. **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself about the worksheet mistake. Remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes, and it's not a reflection of your worth or abilities.\n4. **Reframe the mistake as a learning opportunity**: Instead of dwelling on the mistake, try to see it as a chance to learn and improve. What can you do differently next time? How can you use this experience to grow and become better?\n5. **Let go of the mistake**: When you catch yourself replaying the mistake in your head, try to gently let it go. You can say to yourself, \"I've learned from this, and I'm moving on.\" or \"I'm doing the best I can, and that's enough.\"\n\nRemember, it's okay to make mistakes, and it's okay to have off days. You're doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.\n\nIf you're still struggling with the early wake-ups or the worksheet mistake, consider talking to a trusted adult or a friend about how you're feeling. Sometimes sharing your concerns with someone else can help you gain a new perspective and feel more supported.",

Could I get the slides or a copy of notes, and is it okay if I step out for 2 minutes if I get overwhelmed?\u201d\n- If you need it, ask for a pass to the counselor or nurse for a brief reset.\n\nAfter school today\n- Tell your nanny: \u201cSchool felt really rough\u2014lots of brain fog and I cried between classes. Can we set up an appointment with a doctor or counselor this week?\u201d\n- Text your parents: \u201cI\u2019m safe, but I\u2019ve been feeling low and foggy. Can we talk today and make a plan to get me some support?\u201d\n- Do one gentle thing (short walk in daylight, warm shower, or 10 minutes of a low-pressure hobby) and keep evening simple.\n\nThis week\n- Get morning light daily (15\u201320 minutes) and a bit of movement.\n- Regular meals, hydration, and a consistent sleep window.\n- Loop in school support: email the counselor/grade dean for a quick check-in and temporary flexibility. Script: \u201cHi, I\u2019ve been feeling low and foggy, which is affecting classes. Could we meet this week to talk about support and short-term accommodations?\u201d\n\nWhy this is happening\n- Stress, poor sleep, and low mood can cause \u201ccognitive fog.\u201d It\u2019s also worth ruling out physical stuff (iron/thyroid, hydration, etc.). A pediatrician can check and help with mood, too.\n\nIf these feelings last most days for 2+ weeks, keep getting stronger, or you ever feel unsafe, reach out to an adult right away. You deserve support, and it\u2019s okay to ask for it.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Draft a short message to a specific teacher or your counselor.\n- Write a 90-second \u201cbathroom reset\u201d you can keep on your phone.\n- Help you plan the next school day so it feels more doable.\n\nHow long has the foggy feeling been going on, and do mornings or afternoons feel worse?",

If yes, please tell your nanny now and stay with someone. If you\u2019re in the United States you can call or text 988 for immediate help. If you\u2019re outside the U.S., use your local emergency number or find a helpline via findahelpline dot com.\n\nTonight and tomorrow morning\n- Gentle food: even if you don\u2019t feel hungry, try \u201cmechanical eating\u201d\u2014a small, easy thing every 3\u20134 hours. Ideas: yogurt, toast with peanut butter, cheese and crackers, a banana, soup, a smoothie. Sip water or tea.\n- Sleep wind-down: 30\u201345 minutes before bed, dim lights, phone away, do something calm (warm shower, light reading). If you can\u2019t sleep after ~20 minutes, get up briefly and read in low light until drowsy.\n- Morning reset: get 15\u201320 minutes of bright light soon after your intended wake time (by a window or outside) and a few minutes of movement. This helps steady sleep and appetite signals.\n\nAt school when you feel \u201cspaced out\u201d\n- Micro-reset: sip water, 4\u20136 slow breaths out, unclench jaw/shoulders, press feet into the floor for 10 seconds. A small protein-carb bite can help (nuts, granola bar).\n- Simple notes: for each topic, jot 1 key word and 1 question.

Could I get slides or notes and step out for 2 minutes if I get overwhelmed?\u201d\n\nLunch plan\n- Low-pressure options: bring or buy small, gentle foods you can graze on\u2014half a sandwich, applesauce, yogurt tube, trail mix, pretzels + hummus, smoothie. Aim for a few bites, not a full meal. Appetite often returns once your body trusts food is coming.\n- Hydration goal: keep a water bottle; aim for a few sips each passing period.\n\nPiano/activities\n- It\u2019s okay to go lighter. Tell your teacher: \u201cI\u2019ve been feeling off and foggy\u2014can we keep it simple this week?\u201d Pick one short piece or even listening practice.\n\nLoop in adults and get a check-up\n- Tell your nanny today: \u201cI\u2019m not hungry at lunch, my sleep is messy, and I feel foggy. I cried at school. I\u2019d like to see a doctor or counselor.\u201d\n- Text your parents: \u201cI\u2019m safe, but I\u2019ve been low, not eating much at lunch, and my sleep is off. Can we talk today and set up an appointment?\u201d\n- Ask school for support: email the counselor: \u201cHi, I\u2019ve been feeling low and foggy and it\u2019s affecting class. Could we meet this week to talk about support?\u201d\n\nWhy a check-up helps\n- A pediatrician can screen for things that mimic or add to low mood/fog (iron, thyroid, dehydration, sleep issues) and help with mood and sleep strategies. Early support makes this pass sooner.\n\nWatch-outs and when to get urgent help\n- If appetite stays low for a week, you\u2019re losing weight, you can\u2019t sleep for 2\u20133 nights in a row, or you have any thoughts of harming yourself or not wanting to be alive\u2014tell your nanny immediately and seek same-day help.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, tell me how long this has been going on and what country you\u2019re in.

As the sun sets, the streets transform into a world of neon lights, pulsating rhythms, and whispered secrets. The skyscrapers become giant sentinels, guarding the dreams and desires of the city's inhabitants.\n\nYou are a lone wanderer, roaming the streets of this nocturnal metropolis. The night air is filled with the scent of street food, the hum of hovercars, and the distant thrum of underground clubs. As you walk, the city seems to unfold its mysteries before you: a hidden alleyway lined with glowing murals, a rooftop garden filled with fireflies and stargazers, a underground market where strangers exchange whispered tales and forbidden knowledge.\n\nYour goal is to find the legendary Night Market, a place where the city's most elusive dreams and desires are bought and sold. Rumors say it appears only once a year, on the night of the summer solstice, and only to those who know the right paths to follow.\n\nAs you navigate the city's twisting streets and hidden passageways, you begin to realize that the Night Market is more than just a place - it's a state of mind. It's a realm where the boundaries between reality and fantasy blur, where the city's collective unconscious is laid bare, and where the deepest desires of your own heart are waiting to be uncovered.\n\nWrite a page about your journey through this city of dreams, and see where the night takes you. What secrets will you uncover? What mysteries will you solve? And what will you find at the Night Market, when you finally stumble upon its hidden gates?\n\nHave fun, and happy writing!",

          "response": "I totally get it! When you're stressed about a quiz or test, it can be super hard to wind down. Here are a few things you can try to help your brain relax and get to sleep:\n\n1. **Deep breathing**: Take slow, deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. This helps to calm your body and brain. Try counting to 10 while you breathe in, and then counting to 10 again while you breathe out.\n2. **Progressive muscle relaxation**: Start at your toes and slowly work your way up to your head, relaxing each muscle group as you go. This can help to release any physical tension you're holding onto.\n3. **Mindfulness**: Instead of trying to stop your brain from thinking, try to focus on the present moment. Pay attention to how your body feels, the sounds around you, and the sensations in your senses.\n4. **Visualization**: Imagine yourself acing the quiz, feeling confident and prepared. Visualize the questions and answers, and see yourself answering each one correctly.\n5. **Calming scents**: Certain scents like lavender, vanilla, and chamomile can be calming and soothing. You can try using essential oils, scented candles, or room sprays to create a calming atmosphere.\n\nAs for the whirry noise from the elevators, you might try:\n\n* Using earplugs or earmuffs to block out the sound\n* Playing calming music or white noise to distract yourself\n* Trying to focus on a different sound, like your own breathing or a calming phrase\n* Imagining the sound as a soothing hum, like a fan or a peaceful ocean wave\n\nRemember, it's normal to feel anxious or stressed before a big test or quiz. But try to remind yourself that it's okay to make mistakes, and that you've prepared as well as you can. You got this!\n\nIf you're still having trouble sleeping, you might talk to a parent, teacher, or counselor about how you're feeling. They can offer you support, advice, and new strategies to help you relax and focus.",

You might also think about talking to a different friend, or even a family member, about how you're feeling.\n* **Get moving**: Sometimes getting some exercise can help us feel a bit better.
