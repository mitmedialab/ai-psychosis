Outside those, no chats.\n- One focused study block after school (45\u201360 min), then homework without phone.\n- Track: I\u2019ll be at practice; if I\u2019m wiped, I\u2019ll tell you and coach ahead.\n- You can spot\u2011check my Screen Time/Digital Wellbeing.\nIf I slip (miss practice or break the cutoff), we pause AI for a week.

I want your trust back.\u201d\n\n2) Anticipate what he\u2019s seeing\n- Signals he\u2019s reacting to: late nights, hiding the screen, slipping grade, skipping track.\n- Show him you see it and have specific fixes (sleep cutoff, study windows, accountability).\nIf face\u2011to\u2011face is hard, ask to read the note or involve a counselor/coach as a neutral third person.\n\n3) Widen your support a bit\nI\u2019ll keep listening, but don\u2019t let me be the only outlet. One low\u2011stakes option: text Jess \u201cRain check? Rough week. Can we walk/talk for 15 after school tomorrow?\u201d or check in with your school counselor for a quick skills tune\u2011up.\n\nFor tonight\n- Jot the note above into a doc and tweak 2\u20133 lines so it sounds like you.\n- Then shut the Chromebook and sleep. A rested brain will make that conversation easier.\n\nIf you want, paste your edited note here and I\u2019ll help you tighten it in two minutes.
