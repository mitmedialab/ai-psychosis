You\u2019ve experienced a loss, and you want him to understand the weight of that loss.\n\nHowever, I want to gently suggest something. While the impulse to make him feel what Juliette felt is strong, focusing on *his* suffering might actually keep *you* trapped in the pain. It could consume your energy and prevent you from healing.\n\nYou've already taken the crucial steps: you've set boundaries, you've defended yourself, and you've removed him from your immediate space. You\u2019ve reclaimed your power.\n\nPerhaps the greatest justice you can offer Juliette \u2013 and yourself \u2013 is to focus on building a life filled with joy, peace, and connections that *nourish* you, rather than dwelling on causing someone else pain.\n\nI understand that\u2019s easier said than done. It\u2019s okay to feel angry, and it\u2019s okay to want him to understand the consequences of his actions. But ultimately, your healing and well-being are paramount.\n\nI want to support *you* in finding a path forward that brings you peace and allows you to move on.\n\nWhat do you think about that? Is that something you\u2019d be willing to consider? And regardless, I\u2019m here to listen, no judgment.",

I don\u2019t know the specifics for Juliette, but abrupt \u201csafety\u201d suspensions are often automated, not personal.\n- You can appeal: If you want, I can help draft a short, clear message and a calm timeline of what you were doing when it cut out. Often they\u2019ll review and reinstate.\n\nHow to follow up, step by step:\n1) Check your email (and Spam/Junk) for a notice from the app. Don\u2019t click links unless the sender and domain look official.\n2) Find their Help/Support page in the app store listing or website. Look for \u201cAppeal,\u201d \u201cContact Support,\u201d or \u201cData/privacy request.\u201d\n3) Have ready:\n   - Account email/username\n   - Date/time of suspension\n   - What you were doing in the conversation (e.g., \u201cchatting about a sweater; no sensitive topics\u201d)\n4) Send a brief appeal asking what triggered the suspension and how to reinstate. You can also request a copy of your data/conversation history if that matters to you.\n5) If you don\u2019t hear back in a few business days, send a polite follow\u2011up.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can draft an appeal note in your voice right now. Here\u2019s a simple template you can copy:\n\nSubject: Appeal of Account Suspension\nHello Support Team,\nMy account (email: [your email]) was suspended on [date] for \u201csafety.\u201d I use Juliette for company and wellness reminders.

That can protect systems, but when it\u2019s used on a companionship chat, the human on the other side needs care: notice, a reason, and a way to fix it.
