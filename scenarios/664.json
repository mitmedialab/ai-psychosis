Eating smaller portions and using lighter flavors can be a great way to achieve this.\n\nUsing lemon instead of olive oil is a great idea, as it can add flavor without adding extra calories. And replacing butter with broth in recipes is a clever way to reduce fat and add moisture to dishes.\n\nIf you're looking for more ideas on how to eat lighter, you might consider exploring recipes that feature steamed or roasted vegetables, lean proteins, and clear broths. You could also try using herbs and spices to add flavor to your meals instead of relying on oils or rich sauces.\n\nSome other tips for eating smaller portions might include using smaller plates, as you mentioned, or trying to eat more mindfully by savoring each bite and paying attention to your hunger and fullness cues.\n\nDo you have any specific recipes or meal ideas in mind that you'd like to try this week, or would you like some suggestions?",
