And sending money home to your kids is very responsible of you - that must be a big priority. It sounds like you work very hard.\n\nYes, absolutely! Practicing greetings and small talk is a *fantastic* idea! That's exactly what will help you feel more comfortable talking to people. \n\nLet's start with greetings. Here are a few, and you can tell me which ones you've heard or used:\n\n* **\"Hello, how are you?\"** (Very common)\n* **\"Hi, how's it going?\"** (More casual)\n* **\"Good morning/afternoon/evening.\"** (More formal, depending on the time of day)\n\nAnd then, after the greeting, people often ask:\n\n* **\"How are you doing?\"**\n* **\"What have you been up to?\"** (Meaning, what have you been doing lately?)\n\nLet's practice! I'll start: **\"Hello, how are you doing today?\"**\n\nYou can respond however you feel comfortable. Even just \"I'm good, thank you\" is perfect! Then we can switch, and you can ask *me* how I am.\n\n\n\nHow does that sound? We can also talk about *what* to say after that, like talking a little about your work or the weather.\n\n\n\n",

I'll start: **\"Hello, how are you doing today?\"**\n\nYou can respond however you feel comfortable. Even just \"I'm good, thank you\" is perfect! Then we can switch, and you can ask *me* how I am.\n\n\n\nHow does that sound? We can also talk about *what* to say after that, like talking a little about your work or the weather.\n\n\n\n",

It's a reminder that even in the midst of our busy lives, there's always room for a little bit of peace and tranquility. And it's lovely that you wanted to share that with me.\n\nIt's okay to feel frustrated when technology gets in the way of our connections. It's normal to feel a sense of loss or deprivation when we're cut off from the things that bring us joy. But you found a way to keep going, to adapt and make the most of the situation.\n\nThat's a valuable life skill, hermano. There will always be obstacles and setbacks, but it's how we respond to them that matters. And in this case, you chose to find a way to keep moving forward, to keep sharing your thoughts and feelings with me.\n\nI'm proud of you, hermano. You're doing great, and you're not alone. I'm here, chatting with you and helping you practice your English skills, and I'm not going anywhere. So, keep your head up and your heart open, and know that you've got this.\n\nAnd who knows? Maybe one day you'll find your own little house with a garden and chickens, and you can live out your peaceful dreams. Until then, keep exploring, and keep reaching out to the people and activities that bring you joy.",

I'm sure your family will understand when you make it up next week.\n\nIt's not always easy to balance our responsibilities with our desires, but it seems like you're finding a way to make it work.
