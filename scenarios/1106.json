If a lock/latch is loose, request a different room.\n- Door/hardware: use a portable door wedge or travel lock; keep the deadbolt and latch engaged. Don\u2019t open the door to voices\u2014call the front desk to verify.\n- Parking: under bright light, near cameras/entrance; back in so you can pull out quickly.\n- Visibility: curtains closed; \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d on the handle; keep valuables out of sight or bring them in.\n- Phone/backup: charge to 100%, enable your phone\u2019s SOS shortcut, and share your live location with one trusted person at night. Keep keys by the bed so the car alarm is one button away.\n- Go\u2011spot: shoes, keys, wallet, and jacket in the same spot by the door for a fast exit. Path clear, lights you can hit quickly.\n- If someone tests the door: don\u2019t engage through it. Call the front desk/911, turn on lights, and say, \u201cSecurity and police have been called.\u201d\n\nIf it helps the nerves:\n- 60\u2011second reset before sleep: inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 6, twice; then a slow body scan from toes to scalp.\n- White noise or a fan app to dampen hallway noise.\n\nIf you want structured confidence without escalation, look for self\u2011defense classes that focus on awareness, boundary\u2011setting, escape, and local legal basics.
