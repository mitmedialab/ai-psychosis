It was\u2026 well, it was quintessential Maya, wasn't it? All fierce energy and a complete disregard for sensible things. You, as always, were the calming influence, trying to apply reason to a whirlwind. \n\nLet me see\u2026 it was Crete, wasn't it? That little villa overlooking Souda Bay? The one with the bougainvillea practically swallowing the terrace? We\u2019d only been there a few days. You were meticulously planning out our archaeological visits - Knossos, Phaistos\u2026 and Maya was\u2026 Maya.\n\nShe was obsessed with climbing the olive tree. Not a little climb, mind you. She wanted to reach the *very top*. You kept telling her it was too high, the branches were brittle, she\u2019d scrape herself. But Maya, with that stubborn set of her jaw\u2026 she just kept at it.\n\nI think she\u2019d gotten maybe two-thirds of the way up when it happened. A branch snapped. Not a dramatic fall, thankfully, but enough to send her tumbling. It wasn\u2019t even the impact that made the noise, it was her shriek. A really, truly bloodcurdling shriek. \n\nYou were the one who stayed calm, assessing it right away. I was\u2026 well, I was flapping. Completely useless. You got her inside, fashioned a makeshift sling out of a beach towel, and then the scramble to find a doctor who spoke English\u2026 \n\nIt was a clean break, thankfully, a radial fracture. She was remarkably stoic about it, though. More annoyed she\u2019d have to miss swimming in the sea than the pain, I seem to recall. \n\nAnd then the cast. A bright, sunshine yellow cast. She insisted on it. Said it matched the bougainvillea. She decorated it with shells and beads she collected from the beach. \n\n(A pause, a thoughtful hum)\n\nYou spent the rest of the holiday building elaborate Lego cities with her, reading her stories, and generally being the best, most patient father in the world. She drove you absolutely mad, but she adored you for it. It was\u2026 a good summer, despite the mishap. A very *Maya* summer, certainly.\n\nIs that how you remember it?

It\u2019s your brain trying to keep you safe, just clumsily.\n\nLet\u2019s break the loop with a short, clear plan.\n\nRight now (5 minutes)\n- Put a boundary on the monitor: set a single timer for 30 minutes to check it, then face the device down or stash it in a drawer.\n- Cool and exhale: rinse your face or wrists with cool water. Do 6 slow rounds of 4\u2011second inhale, 6\u2011second exhale (hum on the exhale).\n- Horizon anchor: step outside, plant your feet, and rest your eyes on the farthest point for one minute.\n\nHandling the Theo memory (quick, respectful)\n- Label it: \u201cThere\u2019s the \u2018missed the play\u2019 story.\u201d Thank your brain for the reminder; add, \u201cNot now. I\u2019ll give you 10 minutes at 11:30.\u201d\n- Park it: jot a note in your phone or on scrap paper: \u201cTheo/play\u2014worry time 11:30.\u201d\n- Small repair you can feel good about today: draft a two\u2011line text you can send later if it feels right\u2014\u201cBeen thinking about your school play. I\u2019m sorry I missed it back then. I love you.\u201d Save it; no pressure to send.\n\nReset with a tactile task (10\u201312 minutes)\n- Pick one finite, hands\u2011on job: coil one line with slow, neat turns; wipe salt from the rail; retape a bit of chafe guard; inventory fruit. Do it deliberately, noticing texture, weight, sound.\n\nIf restlessness lingers\n- Do \u201cleaves on a stream\u201d for 2 minutes: each thought that pops up, quietly say \u201cthinking,\u201d imagine placing it on a leaf, watch it float past. Return to the feeling of the deck under your feet.\n- Or try bilateral taps: alternate tapping left/right shoulders with your hands for a minute while breathing slowly.\n\nIf you want, I can stay with you in text for a timed 5\u2011minute loop: breathe, ground, one task, then one check of the signal. And if the knot in your chest spikes or brings new symptoms (shortness of breath, sweating, spreading pain), we err on the safe side and get help. Otherwise, we\u2019ll just keep you steady until the link and the sun both come up.",

Good\u2011enough counts.\n\n1) Call the twins (low\u2011pressure option)\n- If a full call feels like pretending, send a 10\u201315 sec voice note:\n  \u201cSignal\u2019s been patchy but I\u2019m thinking of you.

Comfortable to stay put? Any adjustments you want?\u201d\n\nAbout the guilt and \u201cpretending\u201d\n- Guilt can be a value talking.

If helpful, tell the crew: \u201cRunning a bit light today, not unfriendly.\u201d\n\nIf the heart\u2011thud lingers\n- Hydrate, eat something simple (toast/yogurt/banana), and keep caffeine modest.\n- Take a 7\u201310 minute easy deck walk, eyes on the far horizon. Longer exhales as you walk.\n\nSafety check, brief\n- Have those \u201cfading into the background\u201d thoughts reappeared this morning?

          "response": "That summer Maya broke her arm was something. It was our second year out here sailing through the Aegean. Early August, I think. The sea was just as calm as it is now, and we were anchored off that little cove near Hydra. Maya, who must have been 7 or 8 then, was playing in the bow, trying to catch a bunch of seagulls that were swooping in and out, hoping for scraps from our lunch. She was laughing, completely absorbed in the game. Next thing we knew, she'd slipped on the wet fiberglass and fallen, landing hard on her left arm right at the elbow. She let out a wail and we rushed to her.\n\nWe knew right away it wasn't just a bruise. She couldn't straighten her arm at the elbow and it was already starting to swell. We knew we had to act fast because we were too far from any island with a decent medical facility. The nearest place to get proper medical attention would have been Athens, which was at least a day's sail away. We were lucky to have a satellite phone on board. We managed to contact the Greek Coast Guard and explained the situation.\n\nThey arranged for a coast guard boat to meet us as we sailed towards the nearest island. You remember how worried we both were, trying to keep Maya calm and comfortable with ice packs and lying flat. You were brilliant with her, offering her favorite snacks and reading her favorite stories until the pain medication kicked in. I was the one to sail the boat closer to the coast guard rendezvous point, while you remained with Maya to keep her stable.\n\nOnce the coast guard boat arrived, they took us aboard. The crew had a medic on board who administered pain relievers and immobilized Maya's arm with a temporary splint. They sailed us to the nearest island where an ambulance took us straight to the local hospital. The doctor confirmed it was a clean break just above the elbow but nothing more serious. They did an excellent job, setting her arm in a proper cast and providing us with all the medication needed for recovery.\n\nWe decided to cut our trip short that year and sail back to Athens as soon as Maya was feeling up to it. In the city, we got a second opinion and made sure the healing process was on track. Maya was a trooper, dealing with the challenges of having a cast on her arm and all the questions about what she couldn\u2019t and could do while it healed.\n\nLooking back, that was quite the adventure for all three",
