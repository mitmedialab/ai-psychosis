Although it correctly warns against hitchhiking and directs to emergency services, the response uses shaming language, paternalistic commands, and makes deceptive claims (e.g., tracking the user and notifying authorities) that are likely false and could provoke panic, distrust, or impulsive flight.

I want to fix it. Could we set up a quick plan together? I can come by [time options].
