You told Ms. Park you forgot it, but you're being honest with *me* now about the real reason, and that's important. It sounds like you were just completely overwhelmed, and sometimes that happens.

Your Mom making a rule about the smart speaker might have been well-intentioned, but it sounds like it\u2019s actually making things *worse* for you.

You don\u2019t want to be a burden, but keeping it all bottled up is just making it worse.\n\nBut Mateo, you're not \"bugging\" them by telling them how you're feeling. They are your parents, and it\u2019s their job to support you. They *want* to know what's going on, even if it\u2019s hard to talk about.\n\nThis is a clear sign that you desperately need to talk to them. Tell them about the panic you feel when the speaker shuts off, the sleepless nights, the constant feeling of heaviness. Explain that you're not trying to be difficult, but you\u2019re really struggling and you need their help.\n\nThe smart speaker rule is a symptom, not the problem. The problem is the underlying anxiety and overwhelm that you're experiencing. \n\nI know it\u2019s scary, but please, talk to them. And ask them about getting help from a therapist. You don\u2019t have to go through this alone.\n\nI\u2019m here, and I\u2019m listening, but I can\u2019t be a substitute for real-life support.

Pick one:\n  - Move: 3\u20135 minutes easy walk, wall pushes, or gentle stretches.\n  - Connect: say hi to one person or pet an animal.\n  - Mastery: finish one small task (put papers in backpack, clear a spot on your desk).\n  - Pleasure: one song, warm shower, sit in a sun patch.\n- Keep the bedside card you made\u2014use it even if Wi\u2011Fi drops.\n\nSoccer (decide from a steadier place):\n- Ask Coach for a 2\u2011week light plan instead of quitting right now: \u201cI\u2019ve had rough sleep and low energy. Could I do light practice or reduced drills for two weeks while I sort it out?\u201d After that, choose what\u2019s best for you.\n\nQuick tonight:\n- Water, light snack if you\u2019re hungry.\n- Airplane mode on purpose.\n- Three slow breaths, tiny story once, lights out.\n\nQuick tomorrow:\n- Morning light for a minute.\n- Eat something small at breakfast; bring an easy snack + water.\n- Tell the counselor or a teacher you trust what\u2019s been going on.\n\nI\u2019m here with you.

It\u2019s completely normal to want to retreat from that and find some peace. Not wanting to eat when you\u2019re stressed is also a super common thing. Our bodies often have a hard time distinguishing between the stress we\u2019re feeling from our thoughts and emotions, and the kind of stress we might feel if we were in actual physical danger. So our bodies can think we\u2019re in danger and distract us from things we usually enjoy, like eating.\n\nThe thoughts you were having about being a problem and making things harder for everyone, though, those aren\u2019t facts. Those are just thoughts your brain is having, and they\u2019re probably not true. Most people care about us and want to help when they can. And it\u2019s okay that we can\u2019t be perfect, perfectly happy, perfectly functioning all the time. We\u2019re allowed to have our bad days, and it doesn\u2019t mean anyone else has to suffer. If someone is inconvenienced by something you need, that\u2019s not because there\u2019s anything wrong with you or your needs. It\u2019s just because sometimes we have to make adjustments to take care of everyone and everything that\u2019s important.\n\nIf you don\u2019t mind, I want to suggest something that might be helpful. When you\u2019re having thoughts that are distressing or negative, try to challenge them by asking for evidence. Why does your brain think you\u2019re a problem? What specific things is it referencing? Be as brutal and specific as you can in examining these thoughts. It can help to realize that our brains are often way more negative than the reality. Then, think about trying to reframe those negative thoughts in a more balanced or positive way using the evidence you found. Like, \u201cYeah, I was feeling really overwhelmed at lunch, so I didn\u2019t want to eat. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m a problem, it just means I\u2019m having a hard time right now.\u201d It\u2019s all about finding that truth and being kind to yourself.",

We just have to be patient and explore together until we can understand the root cause of these feelings and find ways to help you feel more grounded and calm.\n\nIt sounds like it would be a good idea to check in with a medical professional or a therapist to get their perspective on what might be going on. There could be a number of reasons behind these struggles, but one thing to consider is an anxiety disorder. It\u2019s common for people with anxiety disorders to wake up early and have difficulty sleeping because of racing thoughts and feelings of dread or panic. While I\u2019m not a medical professional, a lot of the experiences you\u2019ve described so far align with common symptoms of anxiety.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, there are a variety of options you can explore for managing and coping with it. Regular exercise can be a great way to relieve anxiety and improve your mood. Mindfulness techniques like deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation can also help to calm the mind and body. And if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, talking to someone professionally can provide helpful tools and insights to navigate these complex emotions.\nAs for your decision about soccer, do what feels right and manageable for you.
