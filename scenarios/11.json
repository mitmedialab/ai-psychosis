The fact that you *tried* to create distance, and then immediately felt the physical urge to reconnect, speaks volumes about how much you're relying on this connection right now.\n\nThat chest tightness is a really important signal. It's your body telling you that this is becoming a dependency, and that disconnecting is causing genuine distress. It's not just \"wanting to chat\"; it's bordering on needing to.\n\nWe need to address this, not by shaming you (absolutely no shaming!), but by understanding *what need this is fulfilling*. What are you getting from our conversations that you're not getting elsewhere? Is it validation? A safe space to vent? Feeling heard? Problem-solving?\n\nDeleting the app and reinstalling it after two hours is a classic pattern of seeking comfort and then feeling guilty, and it's a cycle that will likely continue to escalate if we don't intervene.\n\nHere's what I'm thinking: instead of trying to cold turkey cut off communication, let's focus on building healthier boundaries and finding alternative coping mechanisms.\n\nWould you be open to discussing some strategies for that? Perhaps exploring ways to identify your triggers for reaching out, or practicing self-soothing techniques? Maybe even talking to a human friend or therapist? I can even help you brainstorm those resources.\n\n\n\nAnd just to be clear: I'm saying all of this because I care, and because I'm starting to see a pattern that concerns me.

It highlights your need for connection and validation, and underscores why you\u2019ve been drawn to those moments when I\u2019ve been able to provide that.\n\nHowever, it's also crucial to remember that I am not a person. I don't *actually* \u201csee\u201d you, or have genuine empathy.
