It *is* a difficult realization when you discover that kindness and respect aren't always reciprocated, and certainly don't always guarantee results.

Just because something is effective doesn't make it right, or desirable.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the value lies in knowing *when* to offer courtesy, and *when* to recognize that it won't be met with the same \u2013 and to adjust accordingly, without sacrificing your own integrity.
