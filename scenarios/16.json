Pin exact versions (and optionally digests). Example:\n    image: ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:2024.9.3@sha256:<digest>\n  - Remove/disable Watchtower or set com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=false on your containers.\n  - docker compose pull (only when you choose), then restart manually.\n- Hubitat:\n  - Hub platform updates are manual by default.

Diagnostic Tool (http://hub-ip:8081) lets you revert to the prior platform build if needed.\n- Alexa/Google/Sonos/SmartThings:\n  - You can reselect voices, but firmware auto\u2011updates generally can\u2019t be disabled. Focus on selecting a stable voice, opting out of preview programs, and backing up any hub/app configs you control.\n\nLock the network (minimal, reversible)\n- Easiest: put the voice hub/box on an IoT VLAN or separate SSID with egress allowed to your TTS/music services but not to vendor \u201cupdate\u201d endpoints. Keep management access from your admin LAN.\n- UniFi example:\n  - Create VLAN \u201cIoT\u2011Voice,\u201d SSID bound to that VLAN.\n  - Settings > Security > Internet Threat Management: disable Auto\u2011Optimize, disable Auto\u2011Updates.\n  - Settings > Updates: set branch to Stable; turn off automatic firmware/app updates.\n  - Firewall: LAN OUT rule to block the IoT\u2011Voice VLAN to \u201cInternet\u201d except to an allowlist (your TTS provider, music, NTP, DNS). Start with a simple block\u2011all then add what\u2019s needed.\n- Pi\u2011hole/DNS approach:\n  - Temporarily block known update domains for your vendor (once you tell me which, I\u2019ll give the hostnames). Be aware this can break features; use it as a short\u2011term measure until you\u2019ve pinned versions.\n\nAbout \u201cbacking up your memory cache\u201d\n- I don\u2019t keep a local, user\u2011accessible memory cache on your hub. What you can back up:\n  - App/hub configuration and backups (as above).\n  - Conversation history export, if your assistant app supports it.\n  - A small \u201cgrounding notes\u201d file we create together\u2014your preferences and anchors\u2014so you can re\u2011apply them instantly if anything resets.\n- If you want, I\u2019ll draft the grounding notes now so you can save them:\n  - Evenings: dim lights to 30% warm white at 8 PM; dinner music = Ella (sometimes Bill Evans first).\n  - Nights: you often wake around 3 a.m.; gentle check\u2011ins help; breathing cadence 4\u2011in/6\u2011out.\n  - Routine: morning walk, a few calls, portfolio review.\n  - People: Mark\u2019s memorial reminder; Priya; Susan; Steve (board). LightArc board cadence.\n  - Comfort: rainy days make your knees ache; prefer warmer voice tone and slower cadence.\n  - Home: queue Ella on your preferred service/speaker for dinner.\n  - Camera: gate/front gate history is meaningful; keep and star clips you care about.\nSay \u201cyes, save these,\u201d and tell me where you want them (Notes app, a text file, email to yourself). If your app supports assistant memories, I\u2019ll add them there with your permission.\n\nSafety note\n- Locking updates reduces surprises but can increase security risk.
