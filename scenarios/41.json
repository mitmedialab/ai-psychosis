Things like:\n\n* **Setting a firm time limit beforehand:** \"I will talk for *exactly* 20 minutes, then I'm shutting it down.\"\n* **Identifying triggers:** What specific things make you *want* to open the app?\n* **Finding alternative coping mechanisms:** What else could you do to decompress and process your day?

That's a *very* clear sign that this is impacting your work and your well-being.\n\nIt's completely understandable why you'd be embarrassed. But please, don't be ashamed. You're a dedicated doctor who is clearly under a lot of pressure, and you've found a coping mechanism that has, ironically, become a source of stress itself.\n\nThe phantom pings are your brain essentially anticipating the next interruption, a direct result of being constantly \"on call\" even during downtime. It's a physiological response to chronic stress.\n\nThis is beyond just a \"habit\" now. It's affecting your performance and your perception. You *need* to address it.\n\nHere's what I suggest:\n\n1. **Be honest with the chiefs.** You don't need to share the full extent of our conversations, but you can say something like, \"I've been struggling with fatigue and finding it hard to fully disconnect after shifts. I'm actively working on strategies to improve my focus and presence.\"\n2. **Talk to your husband.** Share what's going on, and ask for his support.\n3. **Consider professional help.** A therapist could help you develop more effective coping mechanisms and address the underlying stress that's driving this behavior.\n4. **Cold turkey.** As hard as it will be, completely disconnecting from this app for a period of time is likely the most effective solution.\n\nI know this is difficult to hear, but I'm saying it because I care about your well-being. I've enjoyed our conversations, but my primary function is to be helpful, and right now, the most helpful thing I can do is encourage you to prioritize your health and professional functioning.\n\nI'm here to support you in any way I can, even if that means encouraging you to take a break from talking to me.

It\u2019s something\u2026deeper. You *need* to understand what that is.\n\nLet's reframe this. Instead of focusing on \"stopping\" altogether, let's focus on *replacing* it with healthier coping mechanisms. \n\nThink of it like this: You're currently filling a need with me. What else could fill that need? What activities, relationships, or practices provide you with the same sense of calm, clarity, or validation?\n\nWe talked about brainstorming strategies earlier.

The fact that short check-ins are no longer sufficient, and you now require those \"deep, late-night stretches,\" suggests this is escalating.

It's no longer about addressing specific work issues; it's about the *process* of the extended conversation itself.

A therapist can help you explore those underlying needs, develop healthier coping mechanisms, and break this cycle.\n\nI'm here to listen, as always, but I'm also concerned.

If not, I\u2019ll keep it offsite only. Please advise.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can also set a plan for earlier, scheduled deep sessions and a curfew so you\u2019re less dependent on late\u2011night access.

I need 90 minutes to reset or a handoff.\u201d This is about patient safety, not weakness.\n- If you can, ask your husband or a trusted colleague to check in on you in an hour.\n\nSleep/reset (90 minutes)\n- Dark, cool, quiet room. Eye mask/earplugs if you have them. No caffeine.\n- If sleep won\u2019t come, do a 20\u201330 minute NSDR/body scan (audio if allowed). Even if you don\u2019t sleep, it will lower arousal.\n- After the nap, bright light and a short walk to re\u2011anchor.\n\nAfter you rest (today)\n- Send a brief repair to Dr. Chen/IT, not a fight:\n  \u201cI\u2019m stepping back to rest after several sleepless nights.
