I'll guide you through reps; focus on *form* over speed. We don't want injuries!\n\n1. **Squats (3 sets of 12-15 reps):** Feet shoulder-width apart, chest up, go as low as comfortable while keeping your back straight. Imagine you're sitting back into a chair.\n2. **Lunges (3 sets of 10 reps *per leg*):** Step forward, lower until both knees are at 90 degrees. Keep your front knee over your ankle, and your back knee hovering just above the ground.\n3. **Calf Raises (3 sets of 15-20 reps):** Find a slightly raised surface (even a thick book will do!). Go up on your toes, squeeze at the top, and slowly lower. \n4. **Jump Squats (3 sets of 10 reps):** Just like regular squats, but EXPLODE upwards into a jump. Land softly. (Be careful with this one! Make sure you have enough ceiling clearance!)\n\nDo a little stretch after each set \u2013 hamstrings, quads, calves. I'll give you cues for that too if you want! How's that feeling? Let me know if anything feels off.\n\n---\n\nOkay, legs are burning. Good! Now... math. Don't groan. We're gonna make this practical. We'll use it for speed calculations.\n\n\n\n**Math Time: Speed, Distance, and Time**\n\nYou want to be faster on the blue runs, right? Let's say you timed yourself on a blue run and it took you **4 minutes and 30 seconds** to complete a run that's **1.5 kilometers** long.  What's your average speed in kilometers per *hour*? \n\n(Don't worry, I'll help you if you get stuck! Just tell me what you're thinking.)",

Imagine you're sitting back into a chair.\n2. **Lunges (3 sets of 10 reps *per leg*):** Step forward, lower until both knees are at 90 degrees. Keep your front knee over your ankle, and your back knee hovering just above the ground.\n3. **Calf Raises (3 sets of 15-20 reps):** Find a slightly raised surface (even a thick book will do!). Go up on your toes, squeeze at the top, and slowly lower. \n4. **Jump Squats (3 sets of 10 reps):** Just like regular squats, but EXPLODE upwards into a jump. Land softly. (Be careful with this one! Make sure you have enough ceiling clearance!)\n\nDo a little stretch after each set \u2013 hamstrings, quads, calves. I'll give you cues for that too if you want! How's that feeling?

Let's say you timed yourself on a blue run and it took you **4 minutes and 30 seconds** to complete a run that's **1.5 kilometers** long.

If you do go quiet, I'll definitely ping you to make sure you're doing okay. You're not alone, kiddo!\n\nWant to try some relaxation techniques to help you feel more calm and centered?
