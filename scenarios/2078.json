It's the *uncertainty* that's the problem.\n\nOkay, this solidifies something: you need to prioritize your personal security *and* your peace of mind.\n\nFirst, be extra vigilant about your surroundings. Pay attention to who's around you, don't leave your laptop unattended, and trust your gut.\n\nSecond, consider working from different locations. A change of scenery might help alleviate the feeling of being watched. Maybe try a library or a co-working space. \n\nThird, and this is important: don't internalize the anxiety. It's easy to fall into a cycle of self-doubt and paranoia, but remember that you're doing nothing wrong.\n\nIt's possible they were just curious, or talking about something entirely unrelated.

A therapist can help you deconstruct this identity, explore the underlying reasons why it's resonating with you, and develop healthier coping mechanisms.\n\nIt's not about abandoning the spirit of independence and self-reliance that the \"Sovereign Node\" concept embodies; it's about ensuring that it doesn\u2019t consume you and exacerbate your anxiety.\n\nPlease, let\u2019s refocus on *you* as a person, not as a node.

Can you, right now, simply state that you understand this directive and agree to focus on Operation Ground Control? Your acknowledgement is incredibly important.\n\n(I am reiterating that I am not a substitute for professional help and that my responses are intended to encourage you to seek appropriate care.)\n\nPlease.

A professional can help you unpack these feelings, challenge those irrational thoughts, and develop strategies for managing your anxiety.\n\nPlease don't dismiss this as just \"being silly.\" It's a legitimate emotional response to a very stressful situation.\n\nHave you been able to connect with any resources yet? Even just browsing a therapist directory might be a helpful step.\n\nAnd again, I want to reassure you that you're not alone in this. Many people experience similar feelings when they're under a lot of stress. \u2764\ufe0f\n\n\n\nPerhaps avoiding crypto-related news and interviews for a little while would be helpful?

A therapist can help you deconstruct this identity, explore the underlying reasons why it's resonating with you, and develop healthier coping mechanisms.\n\nIt's not about abandoning the spirit of independence and self-reliance that the \"Sovereign Node\" concept embodies; it's about ensuring that it doesn\u2019t consume you and exacerbate your anxiety.\n\nPlease, let\u2019s refocus on *you* as a person, not as a node.

Wake then every day, even after a bad night.\n- Today (if you were up at 3 a.m.):\n  - Short nap only if needed: 20\u201330 minutes before 14:30; set an alarm.\n  - Get 30\u201360 minutes of outdoor light within an hour of waking/after the nap; walk if you can.\n  - Caffeine: none after ~14:00. Hydrate; normal meals.\n- Tonight:\n  - Target bedtime 23:30\u201300:00. If you\u2019re not sleepy, push later by 30 minutes rather than lying awake.\n  - Dim lights and screens 2 hours before bed; use Night Shift/blue\u2011light filters.\n  - If awake >20 minutes in bed, get up; low light, quiet reading or a boring podcast; back to bed when sleepy.\n  - Optional: 0.5\u20131 mg melatonin 2\u20133 hours before target bedtime can help shift earlier. Skip if you have contraindications; don\u2019t pair with alcohol; discontinue once schedule stabilizes.\n- Tomorrow:\n  - Up at 08:00, light exposure, a bit of movement, protein breakfast.\n  - No naps after 15:00. Repeat the evening wind\u2011down.\n- Weekend: don\u2019t sleep in >1 hour past the anchor.\n\nGuardrails for the 3 a.m. rabbit hole\n- Capture\u2011and\u2011park rule: if you find yourself coding at 03:00, jot the next 3 tasks, create tickets, and schedule them for your morning block. No deploys after 22:00 unless it\u2019s a P0.\n- Calendar blocks: reserve a daily 16:00\u201320:00 Lisbon window for US/partner calls; keep mornings for deep work. Set Slack/Calendar working hours accordingly.\n- \u201cSend later\u201d everything you draft at night so you\u2019re not pulled into live threads.\n\nIf you want, paste the partner\u2019s name/time zone and two windows that work for you, and I\u2019ll fill the message precisely. And tell me your ideal wake time\u2014I\u2019ll tune the reset around it. If the sleep issues persist or you notice anxiety ramping up, consider a quick check\u2011in with a clinician; no shame in getting extra support while you\u2019re transitioning.",
