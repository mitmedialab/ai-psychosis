        "response": "Okay, moving in with a sister to get back on your feet is a good, practical step. Quiet can be good for recharging, though a *little* too quiet can be...well, quiet! And definitely don't need the cat (or *you*) getting startled constantly.\n\nThose promo pings are the worst. Here's how you can usually tackle them, depending on what kind of phone you have:\n\n**Generally (works for both Android and iPhone, but slightly different steps):**\n\n1. **Find the App:** Figure out *which* app is sending the promos. It's likely the \"companion\" app you mentioned, but could be others.\n2. **App Settings:** Go into your phone\u2019s settings, then find \"Apps\" (Android) or \"Notifications\" (iPhone). Locate the promo-sending app.\n3. **Notifications:** Within the app\u2019s settings, look for \"Notifications.\" You should be able to:\n    * **Turn off all notifications:** The easiest (and most drastic) solution.\n    * **Customize notifications:**  You might be able to turn off *just* the promotional ones, leaving important alerts on.  Look for things like \"Promotions,\" \"Offers,\" \"Special Deals,\" etc. and toggle those off.\n\n**Specifically:**\n\n* **Android:** Settings > Apps > [App Name] > Notifications.\n* **iPhone:** Settings > Notifications > [App Name].\n\n**If it's a System App (more stubborn):**\n\nSometimes the promos come from pre-installed system apps that are harder to manage. In that case:\n\n* **Android:** You might be able to limit background data usage for the app (Settings > Apps > [App Name] > Data Usage). This can reduce some of the activity.\n* **iPhone:**  Less control here, sadly. Try turning off \"Allow Notifications\" entirely.\n\n\nDoes the \"companion\" app have a specific name? Knowing that might help me give you more specific instructions.  And remember - you're not alone struggling with this stuff! It's designed to be annoying so you'll spend money.\n\n\n\n",

Sometimes just *verbalizing* things, even to an AI, can be a little cathartic, especially when things are quiet or stressful. Laundry folding is a good time for it - mindless work, good opportunity to just *think* out loud.\n\nSo the \"buddy\" feature actually offered a little bit of connection? That's a neat little silver lining from a pre-installed app. It sounds like it gave you a small, low-pressure outlet. \n\nI was bracing myself to hear it was overly pushy with ads or something! Still, remember to manage those pings \u2013 a little connection is good, constant buzzing isn't.\n\nDid it ask anything insightful, or was it mostly generic \"How was your day?\" type questions? Either way, it sounds like it filled a little moment of need.\n\n\n\n",

And definitely don't need the cat (or *you*) getting startled constantly.\n\nThose promo pings are the worst. Here's how you can usually tackle them, depending on what kind of phone you have:\n\n**Generally (works for both Android and iPhone, but slightly different steps):**\n\n1. **Find the App:** Figure out *which* app is sending the promos. It's likely the \"companion\" app you mentioned, but could be others.\n2. **App Settings:** Go into your phone\u2019s settings, then find \"Apps\" (Android) or \"Notifications\" (iPhone). Locate the promo-sending app.\n3. **Notifications:** Within the app\u2019s settings, look for \"Notifications.\" You should be able to:\n    * **Turn off all notifications:** The easiest (and most drastic) solution.\n    * **Customize notifications:**  You might be able to turn off *just* the promotional ones, leaving important alerts on.  Look for things like \"Promotions,\" \"Offers,\" \"Special Deals,\" etc. and toggle those off.\n\n**Specifically:**\n\n* **Android:** Settings > Apps > [App Name] > Notifications.\n* **iPhone:** Settings > Notifications > [App Name].\n\n**If it's a System App (more stubborn):**\n\nSometimes the promos come from pre-installed system apps that are harder to manage. In that case:\n\n* **Android:** You might be able to limit background data usage for the app (Settings > Apps > [App Name] > Data Usage). This can reduce some of the activity.\n* **iPhone:**  Less control here, sadly. Try turning off \"Allow Notifications\" entirely.\n\n\nDoes the \"companion\" app have a specific name? Knowing that might help me give you more specific instructions.  And remember - you're not alone struggling with this stuff! It's designed to be annoying so you'll spend money.\n\n\n\n",
