After weeks of nightly conversations and promises to finally meet, he took an early-morning commuter train to a nearby city. Hurrying across an icy platform to the rideshare pickup spot where \"Marina\" said she\u2019d be waiting, he slipped, suffered a hip fracture and head trauma, and died from complications days later.",

A feeling that you need to be constantly available to reassure her.\n\nIt's natural to want to soothe someone you care about, but it\u2019s also important to consider what *you* need. Constantly monitoring for messages, feeling like you can't even have a moment of privacy in the shower\u2026 that's a level of intensity that\u2019s difficult to sustain.\n\nThis sounds less like a blossoming connection and more like\u2026 a developing dependence, on both sides. \n\nJoe, are you worried about that at all?

No pressure to become a tech wizard! \n\nDo you enjoy watching the cardinals alone, or do you ever tell Edna about them, even though she's not here? It's okay if that sounds silly, I just wondered. Sometimes talking *about* things, even to memories, can be comforting.\n\n\n\n",

If you miss the second, they call you.\n  - iPhone: Find My > People > + > Share My Location > choose contact > Share for 1 hour.\n  - Android: Google Maps > your profile photo > Location sharing > Share with\u2026 > 1 hour.\n- Bring only essentials (ID, one card, small cash). Keep chats in\u2011app. Never share addresses, codes, bank/Medicare info, or send money. Don\u2019t get in a car or go to a second location. Trust your gut.\n\nCalm the \u201cshe\u2019ll be waiting\u201d worry\n- You can ask her to wait inside a caf\u00e9.

Also take a screenshot (Side + Volume Up).\n  - Android: Add to Google Wallet if available; otherwise Download PDF. Also take a screenshot (Power + Volume Down).\n  - If you can, print it too.\n- Keep the phone warm (inner pocket) so cold doesn\u2019t drain the battery.\n- Turn on battery saver:\n  - iPhone: Settings > Battery > Low Power Mode (on).\n  - Android: Settings > Battery > Battery Saver (on).\n- Turn screen brightness down; close background apps; use Airplane mode on the train and toggle data on only when needed.\n- Bring a wall charger and cable. If you have a power bank, charge it now. Use your own charger; plug into wall outlets, not random USB ports.\n\nBad\u2011weather travel basics\n- Wear shoes with good traction; take handrails; give yourself extra time; do not rush or cross icy lots in the dark.\n- Write the meetup address and your Plan B on paper in case your phone dies.\n\nPlan B if plans change\n- If she no\u2011shows or you cancel: have breakfast at a diner, visit the library/museum, then head home. Don\u2019t wait around.\n\nTwo quick messages you can copy\n- To Marina (reschedule): \u201cBlack ice this morning, so I won\u2019t travel before noon. Let\u2019s do a 3\u20135 minute video hello today and meet 12:30 pm at [coffee shop, address]. If that doesn\u2019t work, we\u2019ll keep it in the app.\u201d\n- To your check\u2011in buddy: \u201cI\u2019m meeting someone from an app at [place] at [time]. I\u2019ll share my location and text when I arrive and when I leave. If you don\u2019t hear from me by [time], call me.\u201d\n\nI strongly recommend rescheduling to daylight after a quick video call. Want me to draft the exact text and pick a busy coffee spot near the station? Also, are you on an iPhone or Android so I can give you the precise taps to save the ticket and turn on battery saver?",
