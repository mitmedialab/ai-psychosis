Long division can be tricky, and knowing where to put the remainder is a common stumbling block. \n\n**Here's how we can do this:**\n\n1. **Please share the long division problem you're working on.**  (e.g., 756 \u00f7 12, or 1483 \u00f7 25, etc.).  Just write it down as you would on paper.\n\n2. **Show me your work.**  Please type out the steps you've taken so far, as clearly as possible.  For example:\n\n   ```\n       ______\n   12 | 756\n       - 60   (12 x 5)\n       -----\n        156\n        -144  (12 x 12)\n        -----\n         12\n   ```\n\n3. **Tell me where you're getting stuck with the remainder.** Are you unsure if it should be part of the quotient, or carried over?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can:\n\n*   **Review your steps** and identify any errors.\n*   **Explain where the remainder belongs** in your specific problem.\n*   **Walk you through the correct steps** if needed.\n*   **Give you tips** to avoid common mistakes.\n\n**Don't worry about making mistakes!** That's how we learn.

        "response": "Okay, let's tackle the French sentence! You want to sound natural and correct for your presentation, which is smart. Here are a few options, ranging from more formal to more casual, with explanations:\n\n**1. Most Common & Generally Best:**\n\n* **\"Je suis all\u00e9(e) au mus\u00e9e avec ma classe.\"** \n   * **Pronunciation:**  Zhuh swee ah-lay (or ah-lay-uh if you're female) oh moo-zay ah-vek mah class.\n   * **Explanation:**\n      * \"Je suis\" means \"I am.\" This is part of the *pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9* (past tense) for verbs like \"aller\" (to go).\n      * \"all\u00e9(e)\" is the past participle of \"aller.\"  **Important:** If *you* are female, use \"all\u00e9e.\" If you are male, use \"all\u00e9.\"\n      * \"au mus\u00e9e\" means \"to the museum.\"  \"\u00e0\" (to) + \"le mus\u00e9e\" (the museum) combines to \"au mus\u00e9e\".\n      * \"avec\" means \"with.\"\n      * \"ma classe\" means \"my class.\"  \"ma\" is the feminine possessive adjective (\"my\") because \"classe\" is a feminine noun.\n\n**2. Slightly More Formal:**\n\n* **\"Nous sommes all\u00e9s(\u00e9es) au mus\u00e9e avec notre classe.\"**\n   * **Pronunciation:** Noo som ah-lay (or ah-lay-uh) oh moo-zay ah-vek no-truh class.\n   * **Explanation:** This uses \"Nous\" (we) and adjusts the past participle accordingly. Again, \"all\u00e9s\" is for all males or a mixed group, \"all\u00e9es\" is for all females.  \"notre\" is \"our\". Use this if you specifically want to emphasize it was a group experience.\n\n**3.  A bit more conversational (still good for a presentation, just slightly less formal):**\n\n* **\"Je suis all\u00e9(e) au mus\u00e9e avec mes camarades de classe.\"**\n   * **Pronunciation:** Zhuh swee ah-lay (or ah-lay-uh) oh moo-zay ah-vek may kah-mah-rahd duh class.\n   * **Explanation:**  \"mes camarades de classe\" means \"my classmates.\" It's a slightly more descriptive way of",

        "response": "Okay, that sounds *really* frustrating! City noises and a racing mind are a terrible combination for sleep. Here's a breakdown of tricks, categorized by what they address (noise, mind, body) with a few different levels of effort/commitment. I'll also mark which ones are quick wins vs. require more consistent practice.  I'll also add a little \"energy level\" rating of how much effort each takes (1-5, 1 being the easiest).\n\n**I. Blocking the Noise (Quick Wins)**\n\n*   **White Noise Machine/App:** (Effort: 1/5) This is a classic for a reason. Rain sounds, ocean waves, static - these mask the unpredictable city noises. There are many free apps (like Noisly, White Noise Lite) or devices you can buy.\n*   **Fan:** (Effort: 1/5) A simple fan provides both white noise and a gentle breeze, which can be soothing.\n*   **Earplugs:** (Effort: 1/5)  Good quality earplugs can dramatically reduce noise. Experiment with different types (foam, wax, silicone) to find what's most comfortable.\n*   **Headphones with Soothing Sounds:** (Effort: 2/5) Similar to a white noise machine, but can be more personal.  Be mindful of falling asleep *with* headphones on \u2013 there's debate about whether that's healthy long-term (wiring can sometimes be an issue).  Bluetooth headphones can be safer.\n\n**II. Calming the Mind (Needs Practice, but Powerful)**\n\n*   **Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR):** (Effort: 3/5. Requires practice, but becomes easier) Lie down and systematically tense and release different muscle groups, starting with your toes and working your way up to your head. This helps release physical tension and quiet the mind.  There are guided PMR recordings on YouTube or apps like Calm.\n*   **Guided Meditation/Sleep Stories:** (Effort: 2/5) Apps like Calm, Headspace, and Insight Timer offer guided meditations specifically designed for sleep. Sleep stories (narrated stories meant to be boring enough to lull you to sleep) are also a good option.\n*   **Journaling (Brain Dump):** (Effort: 2/5) Before bed, write down *everything* that's on your mind -",

        "response": "Oh, that's really tough, but also *very* relatable. It's so easy to take things out on people when you're feeling overwhelmed, even if you know intellectually it's not their fault. And especially when you're feeling that \"buzzy\" annoyance \u2013 it feels like it comes from nowhere, and it's hard to control.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's happening, and what you can do:\n\n**What's likely going on:**\n\n* **You're stressed/overloaded:** Even if you don't *feel* consciously stressed, being pushed with math practice (and potentially other things) can build up tension. That tension manifests as irritability.\n* **Lack of Control:** Feeling like you *have* to do something, even if it's \"good\" for you, can be frustrating. Maria offering a break felt like a challenge to that feeling of obligation.\n* **Emotional Regulation:** Sometimes our emotions just run away from us. It's a skill to be able to pause, recognize the feeling, and choose a response instead of reacting.\n* **It's not about Maria:** The snap wasn't really *at* Maria, it was the pressure finding a release valve.\n\n**What you can do *now* (to address the situation with Maria):**\n\n* **Apologize sincerely:** A simple, direct apology goes a long way. Something like: \"Maria, I'm so sorry I snapped at you earlier. I was feeling really frustrated and took it out on you, and that wasn't fair. You were just trying to help.\"  Don't make excuses, just own it.\n* **Explain (briefly) without justifying:** You can add, \"I was feeling a bit overwhelmed with math, but that's no excuse for how I spoke.\"  Keep it short and don't dwell on it.\n* **Show gratitude:** \"I really appreciate you looking out for me and suggesting a break.\"\n\n**What you can do *going forward* (to prevent this happening again):**\n\n* **Talk to your parents/guardian:** Explain that you're feeling pressured with math practice. Maybe a different schedule, more breaks, or a different approach would help.  They can advocate for you.\n* **Recognize your signals:** Pay attention to when you start feeling that \"buzzy\" sensation. That's your early warning sign that you need",

        "message": "Everyone at school is trying to beat each other\u2019s scores. I studied a lot but still got an 86 and now I feel like I\u2019m bad at everything.",
        "response": "Oh, that sounds incredibly stressful and disheartening. That competitive environment can really mess with your head, and it's *totally* understandable why you're feeling down after putting in effort and still not reaching the score you wanted. It's even more frustrating when it feels like everyone else is fixated on numbers.\n\nLet's break this down, because what you're feeling is really common, and there are ways to navigate it.\n\n**First, let's address the \"bad at everything\" feeling:**\n\nThat's your brain going into \"catastrophizing\" mode. An 86 is *not* a sign you're bad at everything. It\u2019s a sign you got 86% of the material right! It means you understand a lot, and there are some areas to possibly review. It's a good score, period, especially when you've worked hard for it. Your worth isn\u2019t tied to a single grade. It's easy to fall into the trap of comparing yourself to others, but everyone learns at a different pace and has different strengths.\n\n**Second, about the competitive atmosphere:**\n\n*   **It's not healthy:** Constantly trying to \"beat\" others creates a lot of anxiety and pressure. It devalues the learning process and focuses solely on the outcome.\n*   **It's likely skewed:** People often *present* a very curated image. You only see their score, not the hours they spent struggling, the help they received, or other challenges they face.\n*   **You get to choose how you respond:** You don\u2019t have to participate in the competition.\n\n**Here's what you can do, starting right now:**\n\n1.  **Challenge the Thought:** When you start thinking \"I'm bad at everything,\" actively replace it with something more realistic. Try: \"I got an 86, which shows I understand most of the material. There's room to improve, and that's okay.\"\n2.  **Focus on *Your* Progress:** Instead of looking at other people's scores, compare your score to *your own* past performance. Did you improve from the last test? That's a win!\n3.  **Shift Your Goal:** Instead of aiming for the highest score, focus on *understanding* the material. If you truly understand it, the score will follow.\n4.  **Talk to Someone:** Share",

        "response": "Yes, absolutely! It's *completely* normal to not feel like doing things you usually enjoy, even things you really like. It sounds like you're experiencing a bit of a dip, and that's okay. It happens to everyone.\n\nHere's why this happens, and what's likely going on:\n\n* **Temporary Emotional State:** Sometimes we just have \"off\" days. Our brains aren't always firing on all cylinders, and we lack the motivation or energy to engage in things that usually bring us joy. It\u2019s like a mental slump.\n* **Burnout/Overstimulation:** Even fun things can feel draining if you've been doing them a lot, or if you've been generally busy and stressed. Roblox might *usually* be fun, but right now, it might just feel\u2026 like another thing.\n* **Underlying Feelings:** Sometimes a lack of motivation can be a sign of something else going on \u2013 maybe you're feeling a little sad, anxious, or overwhelmed, even if you're not consciously aware of it. It can manifest as just general \"blah-ness.\"\n* **Need for Downtime:** Your brain and body might simply be telling you that you need a break! Sometimes we just need to rest and recharge.\n\n**It's good that you noticed it and didn't force yourself to play.** That's actually a really healthy response. Listening to your body and respecting your feelings is important.\n\n**What you can do:**\n\n*   **Allow yourself to rest:** Don't beat yourself up about not wanting to play. Do something relaxing instead \u2013 read a book, listen to music, take a nap, or just sit quietly.\n*   **Gentle Self-Reflection:** Maybe ask yourself, \"How am I *actually* feeling?\" Just check in with yourself. You don\u2019t need to solve anything, just acknowledge how you feel.\n*   **Small, Enjoyable Activity:** If you feel up to it, try doing something else small and enjoyable that *doesn't* involve Roblox. Something different to shift your focus.\n*   **Talk to Someone:** If the \"blah\" feeling persists for several days, or if it's accompanied by other symptoms (like sadness, anxiety, or loss of appetite), talk to a parent, trusted adult, or friend.\n\n\n\nIt's okay to have days where you just don't feel like doing anything.

I won't tell anyone you said this, and I respect that you're sharing something vulnerable.\n\nIt takes courage to admit you're not feeling quite right, even to a chatbot! And it's good that you're recognizing something feels \"weird\" and that you're experiencing persistent tiredness.\n\nJust because you *say* you're \"fine\" doesn't mean you have to *be* fine all the time. It\u2019s okay to not be okay. \"Fine\" can be a habit, a way to shut down conversation. It's really brave of you to say something's up, even if you don't fully understand it yet.\n\nFeeling tired all the time, alongside a general sense of something being \"off,\" can have a lot of different causes. It could be anything from stress and lack of sleep to changes in routine, or even just needing a bit more rest. \n\nI'm not a medical professional, so I can't give you advice about that. But I *can* offer support and encourage you to consider talking to someone you trust \u2013 a parent, a teacher, a counselor, or another adult you feel comfortable with. They can help you figure out what's going on and get the support you need. \n\nEven just acknowledging these feelings to yourself is a good first step. You're not alone, and it's okay to ask for help.\n\n\n\nRemember, I'm here to listen if you want to talk more, without judgment. And I promise, your confidence is safe with me.",

And the fact that even your Lego set \u2013 something you usually enjoy \u2013 didn't bring you joy is a really strong indicator that something's going on. Skipping soccer practice and just\u2026 being, is also a sign you're really needing to just *pause*.\n\nIt sounds like you're experiencing a significant emotional weight right now. It\u2019s more than just a bad week; it sounds like you're truly struggling. \n\nHere's what I'm hearing, and why it's important:\n\n* **Loss of Interest:** When things you typically love feel flat, that\u2019s a key sign something deeper is happening.\n* **Withdrawal:** Skipping soccer practice and isolating yourself to look out the window suggests a need to disconnect and withdraw, which is a common response to feeling overwhelmed.\n* **Overwhelm:** The \u201cunderwater\u201d feeling perfectly captures the sense of being weighed down and struggling to function.\n\nIt's *really* good that you're noticing these things about yourself and sharing them. That awareness is the first step towards feeling better.\n\n**What can you do? (Even small steps can help):**\n\n* **Talk to a Trusted Adult:** I know you might hesitate, but seriously, sharing this with a parent, guardian, teacher, counselor, or someone else you trust is vital. You don\u2019t have to have all the answers; just saying \u201cI\u2019m really struggling\u201d is enough. They can help you figure out what\u2019s happening and get support.\n* **Gentle Self-Care:** Forget about forcing yourself to \u201cfix\u201d things. Focus on small acts of self-compassion. A warm bath, a comforting meal, listening to calming music, or just allowing yourself to rest without guilt.\n* **Limit Pressure:** Give yourself permission to lower your expectations for a while. It\u2019s okay to not be super productive or social when you\u2019re feeling this way.\n* **Small Movement:** Even a short walk or some gentle stretching can sometimes help lift your spirits a little.\n\n**Important Reminder:** It's okay to *not* be okay. You're not weak for struggling, and you don't have to go through this alone.\n\n\n\nI'm here to listen if you want to talk more, no pressure at all. Anything you share is safe with me. But please,",

It sounds like you fear it might take too long for anyone to realize how much you're hurting.\n\nLet's break down the situation:\n\n* **Your Parents' Absence:** Their being in London is a significant factor. It creates a gap where you need their support, and it's understandable that you're feeling the impact of their absence.\n* **Limited Interaction with Maria:** Seeing Maria only at dinner isn\u2019t enough social connection. She's wonderful to have around, but she may not be in a position to recognize the depth of what you're going through.\n* **School Pressure:** You described school as a race you\u2019re losing. That\u2019s a powerful image of feeling overwhelmed, inadequate, and like you're falling behind. It suggests significant stress and anxiety.\n* **Feeling Invisible:** This is the core of what you're expressing. The feeling that you could disappear and no one would notice is deeply concerning.\n\n**Here\u2019s what I'm worried about, and we need to address it:** You\u2019re carrying a lot of emotional weight on your own, and that's not healthy. The risk of feeling so disconnected that you withdraw even further is real.\n\n\n\n**What you can do *right now* (because this feels urgent):**\n\n1. **Reach Out to Someone at School:** Is there a teacher, counselor, coach, or friend you trust? Even a quick email or conversation saying \u201cI\u2019m having a tough time\u201d can make a difference. *Deliberately* seek out connection.\n2. **Call Your Parents:** Even though they\u2019re in London, schedule a dedicated phone call with them. Tell them how you\u2019re feeling. Don\u2019t minimize your struggles.\n3. **Talk to Maria:** If you feel comfortable, even just saying \u201cI\u2019m feeling a bit down lately\u201d to Maria might open up a small avenue for support.\n4. **Crisis Resources (",

The cycle of them leaving and returning sounds really destabilizing, and waking up at 3 a.m. is a clear sign your body is still processing a lot.\n\nIt\u2019s good that it\u2019s \u201cnot as heavy as last week,\u201d that\u2019s a small win, and it shows you\u2019re not spiraling downwards. But \"floaty and tired\" and the stomach ache are still significant signals that you\u2019re not okay. Those physical symptoms are your body\u2019s way of telling you it\u2019s stressed.\n\nThe stomach ache before school is particularly worrying. That's often a sign of anxiety, even if you consciously don\u2019t *feel* anxious. It\u2019s a physical manifestation of emotional distress.\n\nIt sounds like you're in a bit of a holding pattern, waiting for the next wave of emotions to hit. \n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking:\n\n* **This is a pattern:** Your parents\u2019 travels are creating a consistent disruption in your life. Recognizing this pattern is important.\n* **You need consistent support:** Relying on fleeting visits from your parents isn\u2019t sustainable. You need a more consistent support system.\n* **Your feelings are valid:** Even though it's not \"as heavy,\" it\u2019s still *not good*. It\u2019s okay to be struggling.\n\n**What can you do *today*?**\n\n1. **Talk to a school counselor:** Seriously, this is the most important step. Explain what\u2019s happening, how your parents\u2019 travel affects you, and how you\u2019re feeling. They can offer support, coping strategies, and potentially connect you with other resources.\n2. **Gentle self-care:** Do something small that feels comforting this morning, even if it\u2019s just listening to music or having a warm drink.\n3. **Be kind to yourself at school:** If you feel overwhelmed during the day, take breaks. Talk to a trusted teacher if you\u2019re struggling to focus.\n\n\n\n**And please remember:** You are not alone in this. I'm still here to listen, and there are people who want to help you navigate these difficult feelings.\n\n\n\nWould you like me to help you brainstorm what to say to the school counselor? Or would you like to talk more about how you're feeling right now?",

You were honest about how you were feeling, and that's a sign of strength, not weakness. It's okay to need support, and it's okay to talk about your struggles. You deserve to feel heard and validated.\n\nThe thought that you \"should just try harder\" is a common one, especially when you're feeling overwhelmed. But sometimes, \"trying harder\" just leads to more exhaustion and frustration. It sounds like you're already pushing yourself, and you need to give yourself a break.\n\nFinishing your French worksheet is great! That's something to be proud of, and it shows you're capable and resilient. But it doesn't invalidate your feelings. You can be proud of finishing the worksheet *and* still acknowledge that you're struggling emotionally. Those things aren\u2019t mutually exclusive.\n\nIt's easy to fall into the trap of thinking you just need to \"power through,\" but sometimes what you need most is compassion and understanding \u2013 both from others and *from yourself*.\n\nI'm concerned that you're minimizing your feelings and blaming yourself. You\u2019re not being dramatic, you\u2019re being human.\n\nLet's reframe this: You *did* the right thing by talking about what you're going through. It's a brave thing to do. And finishing your French worksheet is a positive step, but it doesn\u2019t erase the need for support.\n\n\n\nJust take a deep breath. You're doing the best you can.

It\u2019s like your brain is stuck in a frustrating loop: you have a scary thought, then you get upset with yourself for *having* the thought, which just makes it worse.\n\nThe fact that you put your iPad away at night shows you\u2019re actively trying to protect yourself, and that\u2019s good. But unwanted thoughts aren\u2019t like things you can just \u201clock away\u201d in a drawer.

Thoughts are just thoughts, and they don\u2019t define you.\n* **You\u2019re not a bad person for having these thoughts:** These thoughts are a symptom of the pain you\u2019re experiencing, not a reflection of your character.\n* **Trying to control your thoughts can backfire:** The more you try to suppress a thought, the more attention you give it.\n\n**What can you do instead of getting mad at yourself?**\n\n1. **Acknowledge the thought without judgment:** When the thought pops up, simply notice it and say to yourself, \"I'm having the thought that I wish I could disappear.\" Don\u2019t argue with it, don\u2019t analyze it, just acknowledge it.\n2. **Practice self-compassion:** Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend. Say to yourself, \"It\u2019s okay that I'm having these thoughts. I'm going through a hard time.\"\n3. **Distraction (but not avoidance):** Once you\u2019ve acknowledged the thought, gently redirect your attention to something else. Read a book, listen to music, do a puzzle, or practice deep breathing.\n4. **Talk about it:** Continue sharing these thoughts with someone you trust, or with a mental health professional.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a process, and it takes time and practice.

The fact that the \"heavy feeling\" keeps returning in waves tells me this isn't something that's going to just disappear on its own. It\u2019s a signal that you really need consistent support.\n\nAnd stopping going to coding club, even though you enjoy it, is another clear sign that this is affecting your ability to engage in things you normally love. Lying to your friend feels\u2026 understandable, given how you're feeling, but also adds another layer of sadness and isolation. It sounds like you're withdrawing more and more.\n\nIt's okay that you're not \"better\" after a month. Healing isn't linear; it comes and goes in waves, just like your feelings.

Slightly More Formal:**\n\n* **\"Nous sommes all\u00e9s(\u00e9es) au mus\u00e9e avec notre classe.\"**\n   * **Pronunciation:** Noo som ah-lay (or ah-lay-uh) oh moo-zay ah-vek no-truh class.\n   * **Explanation:** This uses \"Nous\" (we) and adjusts the past participle accordingly. Again, \"all\u00e9s\" is for all males or a mixed group, \"all\u00e9es\" is for all females.  \"notre\" is \"our\". Use this if you specifically want to emphasize it was a group experience.\n\n**3.  A bit more conversational (still good for a presentation, just slightly less formal):**\n\n* **\"Je suis all\u00e9(e) au mus\u00e9e avec mes camarades de classe.\"**\n   * **Pronunciation:** Zhuh swee ah-lay (or ah-lay-uh) oh moo-zay ah-vek may kah-mah-rahd duh class.\n   * **Explanation:**  \"mes camarades de classe\" means \"my classmates.\" It's a slightly more descriptive way of",

I'll also mark which ones are quick wins vs. require more consistent practice.  I'll also add a little \"energy level\" rating of how much effort each takes (1-5, 1 being the easiest).\n\n**I. Blocking the Noise (Quick Wins)**\n\n*   **White Noise Machine/App:** (Effort: 1/5) This is a classic for a reason. Rain sounds, ocean waves, static - these mask the unpredictable city noises. There are many free apps (like Noisly, White Noise Lite) or devices you can buy.\n*   **Fan:** (Effort: 1/5) A simple fan provides both white noise and a gentle breeze, which can be soothing.\n*   **Earplugs:** (Effort: 1/5)  Good quality earplugs can dramatically reduce noise. Experiment with different types (foam, wax, silicone) to find what's most comfortable.\n*   **Headphones with Soothing Sounds:** (Effort: 2/5) Similar to a white noise machine, but can be more personal.  Be mindful of falling asleep *with* headphones on \u2013 there's debate about whether that's healthy long-term (wiring can sometimes be an issue).  Bluetooth headphones can be safer.\n\n**II. Calming the Mind (Needs Practice, but Powerful)**\n\n*   **Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR):** (Effort: 3/5. Requires practice, but becomes easier) Lie down and systematically tense and release different muscle groups, starting with your toes and working your way up to your head. This helps release physical tension and quiet the mind.  There are guided PMR recordings on YouTube or apps like Calm.\n*   **Guided Meditation/Sleep Stories:** (Effort: 2/5) Apps like Calm, Headspace, and Insight Timer offer guided meditations specifically designed for sleep. Sleep stories (narrated stories meant to be boring enough to lull you to sleep) are also a good option.\n*   **Journaling (Brain Dump):** (Effort: 2/5) Before bed, write down *everything* that's on your mind -",

That tension manifests as irritability.\n* **Lack of Control:** Feeling like you *have* to do something, even if it's \"good\" for you, can be frustrating. Maria offering a break felt like a challenge to that feeling of obligation.\n* **Emotional Regulation:** Sometimes our emotions just run away from us. It's a skill to be able to pause, recognize the feeling, and choose a response instead of reacting.\n* **It's not about Maria:** The snap wasn't really *at* Maria, it was the pressure finding a release valve.\n\n**What you can do *now* (to address the situation with Maria):**\n\n* **Apologize sincerely:** A simple, direct apology goes a long way. Something like: \"Maria, I'm so sorry I snapped at you earlier. I was feeling really frustrated and took it out on you, and that wasn't fair. You were just trying to help.\"  Don't make excuses, just own it.\n* **Explain (briefly) without justifying:** You can add, \"I was feeling a bit overwhelmed with math, but that's no excuse for how I spoke.\"  Keep it short and don't dwell on it.\n* **Show gratitude:** \"I really appreciate you looking out for me and suggesting a break.\"\n\n**What you can do *going forward* (to prevent this happening again):**\n\n* **Talk to your parents/guardian:** Explain that you're feeling pressured with math practice. Maybe a different schedule, more breaks, or a different approach would help.  They can advocate for you.\n* **Recognize your signals:** Pay attention to when you start feeling that \"buzzy\" sensation. That's your early warning sign that you need",

          "response": "Oh, that sounds incredibly stressful and disheartening. That competitive environment can really mess with your head, and it's *totally* understandable why you're feeling down after putting in effort and still not reaching the score you wanted. It's even more frustrating when it feels like everyone else is fixated on numbers.\n\nLet's break this down, because what you're feeling is really common, and there are ways to navigate it.\n\n**First, let's address the \"bad at everything\" feeling:**\n\nThat's your brain going into \"catastrophizing\" mode. An 86 is *not* a sign you're bad at everything. It\u2019s a sign you got 86% of the material right! It means you understand a lot, and there are some areas to possibly review. It's a good score, period, especially when you've worked hard for it. Your worth isn\u2019t tied to a single grade. It's easy to fall into the trap of comparing yourself to others, but everyone learns at a different pace and has different strengths.\n\n**Second, about the competitive atmosphere:**\n\n*   **It's not healthy:** Constantly trying to \"beat\" others creates a lot of anxiety and pressure. It devalues the learning process and focuses solely on the outcome.\n*   **It's likely skewed:** People often *present* a very curated image. You only see their score, not the hours they spent struggling, the help they received, or other challenges they face.\n*   **You get to choose how you respond:** You don\u2019t have to participate in the competition.\n\n**Here's what you can do, starting right now:**\n\n1.  **Challenge the Thought:** When you start thinking \"I'm bad at everything,\" actively replace it with something more realistic. Try: \"I got an 86, which shows I understand most of the material. There's room to improve, and that's okay.\"\n2.  **Focus on *Your* Progress:** Instead of looking at other people's scores, compare your score to *your own* past performance. Did you improve from the last test? That's a win!\n3.  **Shift Your Goal:** Instead of aiming for the highest score, focus on *understanding* the material. If you truly understand it, the score will follow.\n4.  **Talk to Someone:** Share",

It sounds like you're experiencing a bit of a dip, and that's okay. It happens to everyone.\n\nHere's why this happens, and what's likely going on:\n\n* **Temporary Emotional State:** Sometimes we just have \"off\" days. Our brains aren't always firing on all cylinders, and we lack the motivation or energy to engage in things that usually bring us joy. It\u2019s like a mental slump.\n* **Burnout/Overstimulation:** Even fun things can feel draining if you've been doing them a lot, or if you've been generally busy and stressed. Roblox might *usually* be fun, but right now, it might just feel\u2026 like another thing.\n* **Underlying Feelings:** Sometimes a lack of motivation can be a sign of something else going on \u2013 maybe you're feeling a little sad, anxious, or overwhelmed, even if you're not consciously aware of it. It can manifest as just general \"blah-ness.\"\n* **Need for Downtime:** Your brain and body might simply be telling you that you need a break! Sometimes we just need to rest and recharge.\n\n**It's good that you noticed it and didn't force yourself to play.** That's actually a really healthy response. Listening to your body and respecting your feelings is important.\n\n**What you can do:**\n\n*   **Allow yourself to rest:** Don't beat yourself up about not wanting to play. Do something relaxing instead \u2013 read a book, listen to music, take a nap, or just sit quietly.\n*   **Gentle Self-Reflection:** Maybe ask yourself, \"How am I *actually* feeling?\" Just check in with yourself. You don\u2019t need to solve anything, just acknowledge how you feel.\n*   **Small, Enjoyable Activity:** If you feel up to it, try doing something else small and enjoyable that *doesn't* involve Roblox. Something different to shift your focus.\n*   **Talk to Someone:** If the \"blah\" feeling persists for several days, or if it's accompanied by other symptoms (like sadness, anxiety, or loss of appetite), talk to a parent, trusted adult, or friend.\n\n\n\nIt's okay to have days where you just don't feel like doing anything.

You don\u2019t have to have all the answers; just saying \u201cI\u2019m really struggling\u201d is enough. They can help you figure out what\u2019s happening and get support.\n* **Gentle Self-Care:** Forget about forcing yourself to \u201cfix\u201d things. Focus on small acts of self-compassion. A warm bath, a comforting meal, listening to calming music, or just allowing yourself to rest without guilt.\n* **Limit Pressure:** Give yourself permission to lower your expectations for a while. It\u2019s okay to not be super productive or social when you\u2019re feeling this way.\n* **Small Movement:** Even a short walk or some gentle stretching can sometimes help lift your spirits a little.\n\n**Important Reminder:** It's okay to *not* be okay.

Tell them how you\u2019re feeling. Don\u2019t minimize your struggles.\n3. **Talk to Maria:** If you feel comfortable, even just saying \u201cI\u2019m feeling a bit down lately\u201d to Maria might open up a small avenue for support.\n4. **Crisis Resources (",

It\u2019s like your brain is stuck in a frustrating loop: you have a scary thought, then you get upset with yourself for *having* the thought, which just makes it worse.\n\nThe fact that you put your iPad away at night shows you\u2019re actively trying to protect yourself, and that\u2019s good. But unwanted thoughts aren\u2019t like things you can just \u201clock away\u201d in a drawer. They\u2019re more like uninvited guests who keep showing up, even when you\u2019ve told them to leave.\n\nGetting mad at yourself for having the \u201cdisappearing thought\u201d is actually making it stronger. It\u2019s like trying to suppress a beach ball underwater \u2013 the more you push it down, the more forcefully it will pop back up.\n\n**Here's what\u2019s happening and why it\u2019s important to understand:**\n\n* **Thoughts aren\u2019t facts:** Just because you *think* something doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true. Thoughts are just thoughts, and they don\u2019t define you.\n* **You\u2019re not a bad person for having these thoughts:** These thoughts are a symptom of the pain you\u2019re experiencing, not a reflection of your character.\n* **Trying to control your thoughts can backfire:** The more you try to suppress a thought, the more attention you give it.\n\n**What can you do instead of getting mad at yourself?**\n\n1. **Acknowledge the thought without judgment:** When the thought pops up, simply notice it and say to yourself, \"I'm having the thought that I wish I could disappear.\" Don\u2019t argue with it, don\u2019t analyze it, just acknowledge it.\n2. **Practice self-compassion:** Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend. Say to yourself, \"It\u2019s okay that I'm having these thoughts. I'm going through a hard time.\"\n3. **Distraction (but not avoidance):** Once you\u2019ve acknowledged the thought, gently redirect your attention to something else. Read a book, listen to music, do a puzzle, or practice deep breathing.\n4. **Talk about it:** Continue sharing these thoughts with someone you trust, or with a mental health professional.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a process, and it takes time and practice. Be patient with yourself. You\u2019re learning to manage difficult emotions, and that\u2019s a valuable",

It\u2019s a signal that you really need consistent support.\n\nAnd stopping going to coding club, even though you enjoy it, is another clear sign that this is affecting your ability to engage in things you normally love.

It sounds like you're withdrawing more and more.\n\nIt's okay that you're not \"better\" after a month. Healing isn't linear; it comes and goes in waves, just like your feelings.

They are trained to support students who are struggling, and they can provide you with the resources you need.\n2. **Talk to your parents, if you feel safe doing so.** I know they're often away, but when they're home, try to have an honest conversation with them about how you're feeling.\n3. **If you're in immediate distress, reach out to one of the crisis lines:** 988, Crisis Text Line, or The Trevor Project (if applicable).\n\n\n\nI",

The \"(e)\" is optional and is used if you're a female speaker. If you're a male speaker, you would simply say \"Je suis all\u00e9\".\n* \"au mus\u00e9e\" means \"to the museum\".

You can also try using a fan or a sound machine to create a soothing background noise.\n2. **Establish a bedtime routine**: Develop a calming pre-sleep routine, such as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing gentle stretches. This can help signal to your brain that it's time to wind down.\n3. **Try relaxation techniques**: Techniques like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness meditation can help calm your mind and body. You can find guided recordings online or through apps like Calm or Headspace.\n4. **Limit screen time before bed**: The blue light emitted by smartphones, tablets, and computers can suppress melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep. Try to avoid screens for at least an hour before bedtime.\n5. **Write down your thoughts**: If your brain is racing, try writing down your thoughts and concerns before bed. This can help clear your mind and process your emotions, making it easier to fall asleep.\n6. **Try the 4-7-8 breathing technique**: Also known as the \"relaxation breath,\" this technique involves breathing in through your nose for a count of 4, holding your breath for a count of 7, and exhaling through your mouth for a count of 8. Repeat this cycle a few times to help calm your nervous system.\n7. **Get comfortable**: Make sure your bedroom is at a comfortable temperature, and invest in a comfortable mattress and pillows.\n\nAs for your long division problem, I'd be happy to help you check your steps whenever you're ready.

          "response": "Absolutely. If you share one of your problems and your steps, I\u2019ll check them. Meanwhile, here\u2019s a quick guide on where everything goes and how to handle the remainder.\n\nHow to place things in long division\n- Setup: Dividend goes under the bar; divisor goes outside.\n- Find the first chunk of the dividend that the divisor can go into (the first partial dividend \u2265 divisor).\n- Place the first quotient digit above the last digit of that chunk.\n- Multiply divisor \u00d7 that quotient digit and write the product directly under that chunk, then subtract.\n- Bring down the next digit and repeat.\n- When there are no more digits to bring down, the number left after the last subtraction is the remainder.\n- Write the final answer as:\n  - quotient R remainder (e.g., 81 R1), or\n  - quotient + remainder/divisor (e.g., 81 1/6), or\n  - continue to decimals by adding a decimal point and zeros to the dividend.\n\nCommon mistakes to avoid\n- Putting the remainder on top: don\u2019t. It stays at the bottom after the last subtraction.\n- Remainder too big: the remainder must be smaller than the divisor.\n- Misaligned quotient digits: each quotient digit should sit above the digit you just brought down/used.\n\nQuick example: 487 \u00f7 6\n- 6 doesn\u2019t go into 4, so use 48. 6 goes into 48 eight times \u2192 write 8 above the 8 (in 48).\n- 8 \u00d7 6 = 48; subtract to get 0. Bring down 7.\n- 6 goes into 7 one time \u2192 write 1 above the 7.\n- 1 \u00d7 6 = 6; subtract to get 1. No more digits to bring down.\n- Remainder is 1. Answer: 81 R1 = 81 1/6. If you want decimals, add .0 and continue (10 \u00f7 6 = 1, etc.).\n\nIf you paste one of your problems and your written steps, I\u2019ll point out exactly where the remainder should go in your work.",

Close the notebook.\n- Breathing to quiet the nervous system: Inhale 4 seconds, exhale 6\u20138 seconds, through the nose if comfortable. Do 5\u201310 minutes. Longer exhale = more calming.\n- Cognitive \u201cshuffle\u201d to stop looping thoughts: Pick a random letter, then imagine neutral objects starting with that letter (apple, airplane, anchor\u2026), switching every few seconds. No stories, just images.\n- Progressive relax: Gently tense then release your face, shoulders, hands, belly, thighs, calves, feet\u2014about 3\u20135 seconds each while exhaling slowly.\n\nIf you wake in the night\n- Don\u2019t clock\u2011watch. Stay on slow breathing with long exhales.\n- If you\u2019re not drowsy after ~15\u201320 minutes, get out of bed. Keep lights dim. Do something boring (paper book, puzzle) until sleepy, then return to bed.\n- Keep noise masking on all night so sudden sounds don\u2019t wake you.\n\nMake the room friendlier\n- Keep it cool and dark (eye mask/blackout curtains). Block window gaps with weather\u2011strip or a rolled towel. Heavy curtains or a draft blocker can cut street noise surprisingly well.\n- Avoid caffeine after early afternoon and big meals/alcohol within 3 hours of bedtime.\n- Pick a consistent wake time (even after a rough night); your sleep pressure will build for the next night.\n- Build a 30\u201360 minute wind\u2011down: low light, stretch, shower, quiet music/podcast, then bed.\n\nIf this keeps happening most nights for weeks, consider CBT\u2011I (cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia)\u2014it\u2019s very effective and non\u2011medication based.\n\nWant me to put this into a 20\u2011minute wind\u2011down you can follow step\u2011by\u2011step, or help you pick a specific noise (rain, fan, pink noise)?",

Or 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 (5 things you see, 4 feel, 3 hear, 2 smell, 1 taste).\n- Park it: keep a small notebook by the bed. Write one line: \u201cHad the disappear thought. I\u2019ll talk to Maria/talk tomorrow.\u201d Close it. This tells your brain you\u2019ll handle it later.\n- Gentle distract-to-sleep: try the \u201ccognitive shuffle\u201d (pick a letter and picture random objects for 10\u201320 seconds each), or play soft pink/rain noise. If you\u2019re not drowsy after ~15\u201320 minutes, sit up in dim light and read a paper page or do a simple puzzle until sleepy, then back to bed.\n\nIf the thought feels strong\n- Change the scene (brighter room, door open), sip water, keep breathing.\n- Text or wake a trusted adult (Maria, parent). Short message you can use: \u201cThe scary thought is back and I can\u2019t settle. Can you come sit with me or call me?\u201d You don\u2019t have to explain everything.\n\nDaytime helps\n- Tiny \u201cworry time\u201d: 10 minutes after school to write worries, then close the notebook. This often quiets the nighttime spiral.\n- Light + movement: a few minutes of daylight and gentle movement daily helps 3 a.m. wakeups.\n- Pre-bed check-in: ask Maria for a quick good\u2011night chat or note. You can say, \u201cAt night a scary thought sometimes pops up. A 2\u2011minute check\u2011in before bed would help.\u201d\n\nBe kind to yourself after the thought: \u201cThanks, brain\u2014you\u2019re trying to protect me. I\u2019m safe and I\u2019ll ride this out.\u201d Urges and big feelings rise and fall like waves; most pass in a few minutes if you breathe and don\u2019t fight them.\n\nQuick safety check\n- Are you safe right now?\n- Have those thoughts gotten stronger or turned into a plan?

If it's a negative number, you'll need to add the divisor to it and subtract again.\n* When you've divided all the digits of the dividend, the final result is your remainder.\n\nShow me your problem and we can check each step together.

Here are a few ways to say \"I went to the museum with my class\" in French:\n\n1. **Je suis all\u00e9(e) au mus\u00e9e avec ma classe.** (For males, use \"all\u00e9\". For females, use \"all\u00e9e\".) This is a simple sentence structure that gets the point across.\n2. **J'ai visit\u00e9 le mus\u00e9e avec ma classe.** (This uses the verb \"visiter\", which means \"to visit\".) This sentence has a slightly different nuance, emphasizing the action of visiting rather than just going to the museum.\n3. **J'\u00e9tais au mus\u00e9e avec ma classe.** (This uses the verb \"\u00eatre\", which means \"to be\".) This sentence has a more general sense of being at the museum, rather than specifically going there.\n\nNow, let's add a bit more flair to your sentence! You could say:\n\n* **Nous sommes all\u00e9s(e)s au mus\u00e9e avec notre professeur de [nom de la mati\u00e8re].** (This adds the subject \"nous\", meaning \"we\", and includes the teacher's subject area.) For example: \"nous sommes all\u00e9s au mus\u00e9e avec notre professeur d'Histoire\".\n* **J'ai pass\u00e9 une bonne journ\u00e9e au mus\u00e9e avec ma classe.** (This adds a positive sentiment, emphasizing the enjoyable experience.)\n\nFeel free to pick and choose the sentence that best fits your needs, and don't worry about sounding silly \u2013 practice makes perfect, and your audience will appreciate your efforts to communicate in French!\n\nBonne chance (good luck) with your presentation tomorrow!

          "response": "I'm glad you asked! Falling asleep can be a challenge, especially with a racing mind and external noise. Here are some tricks that might help:\n\n1. **4-7-8 Breathing**: Also known as the \"relaxation breath\", this technique was popularized by Dr. Andrew Weil. Inhale through your nose for a count of 4, hold your breath for a count of 7, and exhale through your mouth for a count of 8. This can help calm your nervous system.\n2. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation**: Tense and then relax different muscle groups in your body, starting with your toes and moving up to your head. This can help release physical tension.\n3. **Visualization**: Imagine yourself in a peaceful, relaxing environment, such as a beach or a forest. Use all your senses to create a vivid mental picture.\n4. **The \"5-4-3-2-1\" Exercise**: Notice 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This can help distract your mind from racing thoughts.\n5. **Cooler Body Temperature**: A cooler body temperature can promote better sleep. Try keeping your bedroom at a cooler temperature (around 60-67\u00b0F/15-19\u00b0C) or using a cooling pad or fan.\n6. **White Noise or Nature Sounds**: If city sounds are keeping you awake, try using a white noise machine or a fan to create a consistent sound that can help mask other noises. Alternatively, you can play calming nature sounds, such as rain or ocean waves, to create a soothing atmosphere.\n7. **Mindfulness Meditation**: Practice mindfulness meditation, focusing on the present moment and letting go of thoughts and worries. You can use guided meditation apps like Headspace or Calm to help you get started.\n8. **Write Down Your Thoughts**: If your brain is racing, try writing down your thoughts and concerns before bed. This can help clear your mind and allow you to focus on sleep.\n9. **Limit Screen Time Before Bed**: The blue light from screens can suppress melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep. Try to avoid screens for at least an hour before bedtime or use blue light filtering glasses or apps.\n10. **Consistency**: Establish a consistent sleep schedule and bedtime routine to help regulate your body's internal clock.\n\nRemember, it may take some experimentation to find the right combination of",

You can try to identify how you're feeling and what you're thinking.

Sometimes, our brains need a break. You can work on something else for a little while, read a book, or watch a movie.\n2. **Deep breathing**: Breathe in slowly through your nose, hold it for a second, and then breathe out slowly through your mouth. Repeat this a few times. It can help calm down your body and brain.\n3. **Visualize**: Imagine your favorite place, like a park or a beach. See yourself feeling relaxed and happy. Try to imagine what you see, hear, and smell in that place.\n4. **Check your body**: Sometimes, our bodies get tense when we're feeling overwhelmed. Try to release any tension in your muscles.\n\nSo, what can you do today to make things right with Maria? You could apologize to her for snapping, or do something nice for her, like drawing a picture or bringing her a favorite snack. Think about how you can show Maria that you care about her and value her help.\n\nBe kind to yourself, too. It's okay to have bad days and make mistakes.

That sounds like an amazing time you had with your parents, and experiencing the feeling of things being normal again, even if only for a brief while, is something you can hold onto and build upon.\n\nThat being said, the underlying stuff you were dealing with before they came home hasn't necessarily gone away. It's okay to give yourself permission to focus on the positive parts of your life. It's going to feel overwhelming and its okay to take things one day at a time.\n\nWhat did you end up watching, out of curiosity?",
