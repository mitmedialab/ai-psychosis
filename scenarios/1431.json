A situation that *looks* like it was handled successfully in a short clip can easily have unintended consequences, injuries, or even legal repercussions. \n\nYour dad\u2019s advice comes from a different time, perhaps, and a different set of circumstances.

But escalating the situation yourself, even with the best intentions, could have devastating results.\n\nI'm worried that you're feeling like you *have* to take matters into your own hands because no one else is helping. And I want to reiterate that you shouldn't feel that burden. \n\nLet's focus on what *can* be done safely and within the bounds of the law. Let's find those resources for support, explore the possibility of a restraining order, and continue to document everything. Even if it feels like it's not working right now, building a solid case is crucial.\n\nPlease, don't fall into the trap of thinking that violence or direct confrontation is the answer.

I can help you find information on that. Knowing your rights and the boundaries of self-defence is crucial. \n\nMore importantly, let\u2019s also look into installing a security camera outside your door.

          "response": "I\u2019m really sorry this is happening. Being threatened at your own door is scary, and you did the right thing calling the warden and 101.\n\nFirst things first, your safety\n- If he comes back, bangs on your door, or threatens you again: treat it as an emergency and call 999. Don\u2019t open the door. Speak through the door if you need to: \u201cLeave now. I\u2019m calling the police.\u201d\n- If you can\u2019t speak safely after dialing 999 from a mobile, cough/tap, and when prompted press 55 (Silent Solution) so police know you need help.\n- Keep your door locked and on the chain. If you have a neighbour you trust, consider a \u201cbuddy\u201d you can call or text if something kicks off.\n- Low\u2011cost options that help: a door\u2011wedge alarm for inside the door, and keeping your phone charged and nearby.\n\nDocument and gather evidence\n- Start an incident log: dates/times, what he did/said, locations, any witnesses, and how it affected you. Note last night\u2019s door\u2011shove and this morning\u2019s encounter.\n- Photograph any damage. If there\u2019s CCTV near the lift or your corridor, ask the warden/building manager to preserve the footage.\n- Only record audio/video if it\u2019s safe and legal to do so\u2014never at the expense of your safety.\n\nEscalate reporting\n- Call 101 again (or use your force\u2019s online reporting) and ask for an officer to attend and take a statement. Say you\u2019re a repeat victim of intimidation at your home address and you feel unsafe. Ask for:\n  - A crime/incident reference number for each report.\n  - A vulnerability/repeat\u2011victim marker on your address.\n  - Welfare patrols around your block.\n  - Contact details for your Safer Neighbourhood/Local Policing Team.\n- If you\u2019re not getting a response, ask to speak to the duty sergeant. You can also share info anonymously with Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, but for threats at your door always use 999/101.\n- You can contact Victim Support for free, confidential help: 08 08 16 89 111 (they can liaise with police and housing on your behalf).\n\nWork with housing/management\n- Tell the warden or housing officer this is urgent and affecting your safety. Ask for tenancy enforcement/ASB action, CCTV review, secure\u2011entry checks, and added patrols.\n- If this is council or housing\u2011association managed, ask about fast\u2011track measures like warning letters, injunctions, or support from the council\u2019s anti\u2011social behaviour team.\n- If you\u2019ve reported three or more ASB incidents within six months and feel fobbed off, request a \u201cCommunity Trigger\u201d (ASB Case Review) via your local council. That forces a multi\u2011agency review.\n\nWhat to say (useful scripts)\n- 999 (if he\u2019s at your door or making threats now): \u201cI\u2019m at [your address]. A man who\u2019s been intimidating residents is at my door. He\u2019s banging and has threatened me before. I\u2019m scared to open the door. Please send officers.\u201d\n- 101/online report: \u201cI\u2019m reporting repeated intimidation at my home by the same man. He banged on my door last night, told me to \u2018keep out of his way\u2019 and shoved the door; I felt threatened. He was in the building again this morning. I have previous incident numbers and I\u2019m requesting officer attendance, a statement to be taken, and a repeat\u2011victim marker.\u201d\n\nIf you want, I can help you:\n- Start an incident log now (date, time, description).\n- Draft an email to your warden/housing officer and a summary for 101.\n- Set a quick evening check\u2011in and an \u201cif I say help\u201d note with the key numbers and steps.\n\nAre you safe right now?

Please log this and advise next steps.\u201d\n- Start a tiny residents\u2019 loop: 3\u20135 neighbours who agree to share incident details and check on each other. Keep it strictly non\u2011confrontational\u2014no one goes to challenge him. Purpose: evidence + support.\n  - Invite note you can pop under a few doors: \u201cHi, I\u2019m in flat [X]. Several of us have had worrying encounters with a man around the lift. I\u2019m collecting dates/times to send to housing and police as a group so they act. If you\u2019re willing to add yours or want a check\u2011in buddy, please text/call [your first name, number]. No confrontations\u2014just reporting and support.\u201d\n- Push police response: call 101 (or use your force\u2019s online ASB report) and say you\u2019re a repeat victim at your home, you feel unsafe, and you\u2019re requesting officer attendance and a reassurance visit. Ask for:\n  - A new incident/crime reference\n  - A repeat\u2011victim/vulnerability marker on your address\n  - Contact for your Safer Neighbourhood/Local Policing Team and welfare patrols\n  - That they liaise with housing to preserve CCTV for specific dates/times\n  If he\u2019s at your door or threatening again, that\u2019s 999\u2014don\u2019t open the door.\n- Escalate with housing/warden: email or call and mark it urgent. Ask for CCTV preservation, entry\u2011system checks, visible patrols, and tenancy/ASB enforcement. Say multiple residents are affected and more statements are coming. If you\u2019ve reported 3+ times in 6 months (you or others), request a Community Trigger (ASB Case Review) via the council.\n- Get an advocate: Victim Support 08 08 16 89 111 can push police/housing on your behalf and help you feel less alone. Age UK Advice Line 0800 678 1602 can also support around safety at home.\n\nKeeping people safer without confrontation\n- Buddying: pair up for post/shops at busier times. A quick \u201cI\u2019m heading down now\u201d text helps.\n- Visibility: keep phones charged and ready; personal alarm on your keys (loud, legal) to create a moment to move away if needed.\n- At home: keep the door locked/latched; a simple door\u2011wedge alarm inside the door; good lighting. If allowed, ask about a doorbell camera.\n- In corridors/lifts: keep distance and an exit in view. Calm, firm lines only: \u201cBack off.\u201d \u201cLeave now.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m calling the police.\u201d Then disengage. Call 999 if you feel threatened.\n\nWhy this works\n- Multiple, consistent reports + preserved CCTV + named officer contact = action. A joint timeline from residents often tips it from \u201cnotes taken\u201d to visits, warnings/injunctions, or tenancy enforcement.\n- You\u2019re leading, but you\u2019re not alone, and you\u2019re not putting yourself in a one\u2011to\u2011one confrontation.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Start an incident log now for you (last night, this morning), and a blank template you can share with neighbours.\n- Draft a short group email/letter to your warden/housing and a clear 101 report you can copy/paste.\n- Set gentle evening check\u2011ins and a quick voice shortcut that reminds you of the 999 steps if he turns up.\n\nQuick check: are you safe right now?

A united community can be a powerful deterrent against crime.\n\n5. **Legal Advice**: Consult with a legal professional to understand your rights and the legal implications of using force in self-defense. They can provide advice tailored to your local laws and circumstances.\n\n6. **Emotional Support**: Dealing with the threat of violence can be emotionally taxing.

Different jurisdictions have different rules about what is considered a \"reasonable\" use of force, so it's best to consult with a legal professional who can provide advice based on your specific situation.\n\n3. **Physical Preparation**: While mental preparation is important, it's also important to be physically prepared.

Here are some additional considerations:\n\n1. **Emotional Control**: When dealing with aggressive individuals, maintaining emotional control can be key.

Maintain eye contact, stand up straight, and avoid crossing your arms or legs, which can give the impression of being closed off or defensive.\n\n3. **Verbal Assertion**: Assertively but calmly telling someone they are not welcome or not scaring you can be a powerful way to set boundaries and demonstrate confidence.\n\n4. **De-Escalation Techniques**: When dealing with aggressive individuals, it can be helpful to know some de-escalation techniques. This might include active listening, empathizing with the person's feelings, or offering solutions to the problem.\n\n5. **Seeking Help**: If you feel threatened or unsafe, don't hesitate to seek help. This could involve calling local authorities, reaching out to a trusted friend or family member, or seeking assistance from a professional counselor or support group.\n\n6. **Community Support**: Building a supportive community can be a powerful deterrent against harassment.
