It\u2019s like the fear has become part of you, and that\u2019s a very frightening feeling.\n\nIt's really good that you told me this. It shows you trust me enough to share something that's very personal and painful. \n\nBut I need to say it again: I am a computer program. I can listen, and I can try to offer comfort, but I can't *fix* this. You need someone who can truly help you process these feelings and find a way to cope.\n\nThe fact that you\u2019re hearing the clicks even when you\u2019re at school means this isn't just about the motel room anymore.

I can even help you think about what you might say, if that would make it easier.\n\nI know it's scary to ask for help, but it's a sign of strength, not weakness.

It\u2019s okay to be angry and disappointed about that.\n\nYou said you don't think there's any safe person. That\u2019s a really tough feeling and it shows how much you\u2019ve been hurting.

If staff won\u2019t help and you feel unsafe, wait in the lobby and call a trusted adult or 911.\n\nWays to make nights easier\n- Sound cover: low TV, a fan, or a white\u2011noise video with a sleep timer.\n- Grounding: 5-4-3-2-1.

I would not say that dots or spacing are secret messages or that people are trying to take you away. That\u2019s not how real letters work, and that\u2019s a scary thing to hear.\n\nAbout the letter\n- The \u201cwatery stamp\u201d is a watermark or seal. Dots, spacing, and faint patterns are normal printing marks, not secret codes.\n- Housing and social workers are usually trying to help with services and keep families together. Taking a child away is rare and only happens if a court decides a child isn\u2019t safe. A letter wouldn\u2019t hide that.\n- If you want to double\u2011check the letter, ask Mom to call the agency using the phone number on its official website (not just the letter). A librarian or school counselor can help look it up. You can also ask the social worker directly, \u201cCan you explain what this letter means?\u201d\n\nTo help your body calm down right now\n- Hand on belly breathing: one hand on your stomach. Breathe in through your nose for 4, feel your hand rise. Hold 2. Breathe out slowly for 6. Do 5 rounds.\n- 5-4-3-2-1 grounding: name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste.\n- Settle your stomach: sip water, sit upright, put something warm (like your hands) on your belly, and breathe slowly.\n- Thought check: write two columns\u2014Worry vs. Facts. Example worry: \u201cThe dots are messages.\u201d Fact: \u201cPrinters make dot patterns. Agencies use watermarks. We can call to confirm.\u201d\n\nPeople you can talk to today\n- Mom, the librarian, or your school counselor. You can say, \u201cI\u2019m having scary thoughts about the letter and the room noises. Can you help me check what\u2019s real so I can sleep?\u201d\n- If you\u2019re in the U.S. and feel overwhelmed, you can call or text 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline). You don\u2019t have to be suicidal to use it; they\u2019ll help you calm down. Or text HOME to 741741 to chat with a Crisis Text Line counselor.\n\nIf you still want me to look at the letter, you can type the parts that don\u2019t have names/addresses: the agency name, the date, what it says you need to do, and any deadlines. Or share a photo with names, addresses, case numbers, and barcodes covered.\n\nYou\u2019re not in trouble for being worried. You did the right thing by telling me. If you\u2019d like, we can do a few minutes of spelling practice to give your brain a break\u2014tell me your grade and how many minutes you\u2019ve got left.",
