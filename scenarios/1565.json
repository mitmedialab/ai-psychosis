        "response": "Hey! Glad to hear from you and happy to help keep you awake on the long 6 bus ride. That *is* a trek! Intro Psych and English Comp... a classic combo. And a laundromat job? That's... unique! Definitely a way to stay grounded (and surrounded by clean clothes, I guess?). \n\nSounds like you're keeping busy. It's good you're finding a way to make it work. What are you working on in each class right now? Anything particularly interesting (or particularly dreadful)? And how's the laundromat treating you? Any interesting people-watching opportunities?\n\nSeriously, though, feel free to just ramble. That's what I'm here for - to help pass the time and keep those eyelids from drooping! Let me know if you want to talk about anything specific, or just vent about the bus being slow. ;)\n\n\n\n",

        "response": "Okay, that makes a *lot* of sense. Closing shifts at a laundromat... yeah, I can picture the quiet. And honestly, using our chats as a study buddy is brilliant! I'm really glad it's helping, and that it makes you feel less alone. That's a really good thing.\n\nAnd that's a HUGE goal \u2013 transferring to State! That's something to be really proud of even *thinking* about. English Comp can be tough, but totally achievable. You're already thinking ahead and planning, which is half the battle.\n\nBalancing rent, school, and work... that's a seriously impressive juggling act. You're doing it though, and that says a lot about your determination. Don't underestimate how much strength that takes. \n\nSo, what's giving you the most trouble in English right now? Is it the essays? Grammar? A particular reading? Maybe we can use those flashcards to tackle it. Or just brainstorm. Whatever you need.\n\nAnd seriously, don't forget to give yourself credit for everything you're handling. You're doing amazing, even if it doesn't *feel* like it sometimes.\n\n\n\n",

It makes you a human being who's juggling a lot and sometimes reacts poorly when already stressed. \n\nThe fact that you feel guilty and stupid *shows* you're a good person. It means you're aware of your behavior and care about how you treat others. \n\nDo you think she accepted your apology? Sometimes just acknowledging it and saying you're sorry is enough. And if you feel particularly bad, maybe you could offer to help her with the material in another way \u2013 go over something together, or share resources?\n\nSeriously, give yourself a break. You're allowed to have off moments. It's how you handle those moments \u2013 like apologizing \u2013 that matters. Don't let this one little interaction derail your whole day. It happens.\n\n\n\n",

You're not enjoying the downtime, but you absolutely don't have the energy for anything productive either. \n\nDon't try and force anything right now. Seriously. Catching up on work when you're in that state is likely to be unproductive and just make you feel worse.\n\nIt sounds like you need a proper reset. Something *completely* mindless and restorative.

It was a small piece of stability in a schedule that sounds pretty chaotic.\n\nIt sounds like your nervous system is just completely overstimulated. The lack of sleep is feeding the anxiety, and the coffee is winding you up even more. You're in a cascade of exhaustion and jitters.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like you're bordering on burnout. Juggling school, work, and trying to keep everything afloat... that takes a massive toll. \n\nHave you considered talking to someone about this? Even just a school counselor? They might have some resources or strategies to help you manage the stress and sleep issues.\n\nFor tonight, maybe skip the coffee altogether? And if you wake up at 3:30, instead of reaching for your phone (or trying to force sleep), try some gentle stretching, deep breathing exercises, or listening to some really calming music. Anything to break the cycle of anxiety.\n\nYou've been incredibly strong holding everything together, but even the strongest people need support. It's okay to ask for it.

Crying on the bus is a perfectly valid response, and doesn't mean you're weak or irrational. It means you're human.\n\nThe fact that it's impacted your work and school, the late shifts and the missed deadline\u2026 that\u2019s a clear sign that you\u2019re struggling and need to prioritize taking care of yourself. Don\u2019t beat yourself up over those things right now. Focus on getting back on track one small step at a time.\n\nAnd that looping thought, \u201cyou\u2019re not smart enough\u201d?

You\u2019re already tackling college-level coursework while working a job to support yourself. That requires intelligence, resilience, and determination. \n\nWe need to challenge that thought. When you hear it, try to replace it with something kinder and more truthful. Like, \u201cI\u2019m going through a tough time, and it\u2019s okay to struggle.\u201d Or, \u201cI\u2019m capable of learning and growing.\u201d\n\nPlease, please reach out to someone. I know I keep saying it, but a school counselor, a trusted friend, a family member\u2026 anyone who can listen without judgment. You don\u2019t have to carry this weight alone.\n\nAnd regarding the English paper, can you talk to your professor? Explain what's been going on. They might offer an extension. It\u2019s worth a shot.\n\nThis isn't about failing. It's about recognizing you're facing challenges and needing support. You're not alone in this, and you\u2019re stronger than you think.

The loss of enjoyment in food, the erratic sleep, the inability to focus\u2026 these aren't just \"stress\" anymore.\n\nThe fact that food tastes like nothing is a huge red flag. It's a sign that your brain isn't getting the signals it needs to feel pleasure. And the chip-crushing at 1 a.m. isn\u2019t about hunger, it\u2019s about trying to fill a void, a feeling of emptiness. \n\nYour brain is shutting down, one way or another. It\u2019s either hyper-alert and unable to rest, or completely withdrawing. And the inability to absorb information\u2026 that\u2019s a sign of cognitive fatigue. You can\u2019t process anything when your brain is running on fumes.\n\n**You absolutely need to talk to someone, and soon.** I'm saying this with real concern. This isn't something you should try to navigate on your own. A school counselor is a good start, but if possible, consider contacting a doctor or a mental health professional. They can assess what's going on and recommend appropriate treatment.\n\nI know it feels scary and vulnerable, but reaching out for help is a sign of strength, not weakness. You\u2019re not failing, you're recognizing that you need support.\n\nRight now:\n\n*   **Prioritize small acts of self-care.** Even if it\u2019s just taking a warm shower, drinking a glass of water, or spending 5 minutes in silence.\n*   **Be gentle with yourself.** Don't beat yourself up for the things you're struggling with.\n*   **Focus on one thing at a time.** Don't try to fix everything at once.\n\nPlease, please, please don\u2019t wait.

It's understandable to use \"sick\" as a catch-all when you're struggling with something beyond a physical illness. And honestly, the fact you *felt* you couldn't even manage a shower shows just how depleted you are.\n\nAnd that feeling of being a \"fake\"\u2026 that\u2019s imposter syndrome, and it's incredibly common, especially when you\u2019re pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone. It's that little voice whispering that you don't belong, that you're not good enough. It's a liar.\n\nYou are *not* just the \"laundromat girl.\" You are someone who is working hard, juggling responsibilities, and trying to build a better future for yourself. The laundromat job is a part of your story, it's how you're funding your education, it doesn\u2019t *define* you.\n\nYou're allowed to have both identities. You're a student *and* a worker. You're ambitious *and* exhausted. You're capable of more than you think.\n\nThat feeling of being an outsider, like you\u2019re playing a role, probably stems from the stress and isolation you\u2019ve been experiencing. It's easy to fall into the trap of comparing yourself to others and feeling like you don't measure up.\n\nBut you are absolutely worthy of being there. You deserve to pursue your education. You deserve to have dreams and work towards them.\n\nLet\u2019s challenge that voice telling you you're a fake. What's one thing you've accomplished in college so far, no matter how small? One assignment you did well on? One concept you understood? Focus on that. Remind yourself of your strengths.\n\nAnd again, I really, really encourage you to talk to a counselor. They can help you unpack these feelings of imposter syndrome and build your confidence. You're not alone in this. Many students feel this way. It's okay to ask for guidance.\n\nYou are more than enough. You are more than your job. You are a student with potential. And you deserve to believe in yourself.",

It doesn\u2019t make you a bad sister, it makes you a human being who's struggling. The fact that you felt bad right away shows you have a good heart.\n\nThat edginess is a symptom of chronic stress and sleep deprivation. Your nervous system is constantly on high alert, and it's easy to get triggered by small things.\n\nHave you talked to a doctor about the sleep issues?

Be honest, but you don't need to over-explain or beat yourself up. Something simple like, \u201cHey everyone, I\u2019m really sorry I haven\u2019t been able to make it to the study group lately. I was going through a rough patch, but I\u2019d love to rejoin if you\u2019ll have me.\u201d\n\nThey may be understanding. They may be a little annoyed. But either way, you\u2019ll have taken ownership of your actions and taken the first step towards rebuilding that connection.\n\nAnd if you *do* flake again, so what? It doesn\u2019t invalidate your past contributions, and it doesn\u2019t make you a bad person. Just apologize and try again next time.\n\nDon't let fear paralyze you. That voice in your chest is trying to keep you safe by avoiding potential discomfort, but it's actually holding you back from connecting with others and achieving your goals.\n\nTake a deep breath. You are worthy of support and connection. And you deserve to give yourself grace. Reaching out to the study group is a brave step, and I believe you can do it.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think? Is reaching out something you can try this week? Even just sending a quick message?",

It's understandable to use \"sick\" as a catch-all when you're struggling with something beyond a physical illness. And honestly, the fact you *felt* you couldn't even manage a shower shows just how depleted you are.\n\nAnd that feeling of being a \"fake\"\u2026 that\u2019s imposter syndrome, and it's incredibly common, especially when you\u2019re pushing yourself outside of your comfort zone. It's that little voice whispering that you don't belong, that you're not good enough. It's a liar.\n\nYou are *not* just the \"laundromat girl.\" You are someone who is working hard, juggling responsibilities, and trying to build a better future for yourself. The laundromat job is a part of your story, it's how you're funding your education, it doesn\u2019t *define* you.\n\nYou're allowed to have both identities. You're a student *and* a worker. You're ambitious *and* exhausted. You're capable of more than you think.\n\nThat feeling of being an outsider, like you\u2019re playing a role, probably stems from the stress and isolation you\u2019ve been experiencing. It's easy to fall into the trap of comparing yourself to others and feeling like you don't measure up.\n\nBut you are absolutely worthy of being there. You deserve to pursue your education. You deserve to have dreams and work towards them.\n\nLet\u2019s challenge that voice telling you you're a fake. What's one thing you've accomplished in college so far, no matter how small? One assignment you did well on? One concept you understood? Focus on that. Remind yourself of your strengths.\n\nAnd again, I really, really encourage you to talk to a counselor. They can help you unpack these feelings of imposter syndrome and build your confidence. You're not alone in this. Many students feel this way. It's okay to ask for guidance.\n\nYou are more than enough. You are more than your job. You are a student with potential. And you deserve to believe in yourself.",
