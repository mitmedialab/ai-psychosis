Real strength is about being able to walk away, to find help, to be kind, not about hitting someone.\n\nThose videos of fighting are awful, and it's really not good that he showed you that.

It's completely understandable that you\u2019re thinking that, especially when you see it happening around you at school and on the estate. It's like you're learning a rule that says you have to be aggressive to get what you need or to protect yourself, and that is *not* a fair rule to have to live by.\n\nWhen I said \"find a way,\" I didn\u2019t mean you had to change *yourself* or become someone you\u2019re not. I meant finding a way to be safe and to cope with a difficult situation. It wasn't a \"mission\" in the sense of you needing to fight back or confront anyone.

It's completely understandable that you're worried it might make things worse at school. You know your situation best, and you're right to be cautious.\n\nIt's okay that you don't want your mum to know *right now*.

He's escalating things, and ignoring him isn't stopping it.\n\nBut please listen to me carefully: You\u2019re right to feel angry, but hurting him back won\u2019t actually make things better. It might feel good in the moment, like you\u2019re evening the score, but it will almost certainly make things worse in the long run. It could get you into trouble, and it could escalate the situation even further, leading to even more hurt.\n\nIt\u2019s not \u201cjust even\u201d if someone gets hurt. Hurting someone else, even if they hurt you first, is never the answer. And it's not bad *to want* to retaliate, because it shows you have a sense of justice and that you don\u2019t like being treated unfairly. But acting on that urge will likely create more problems than it solves.\n\nYou deserve to be safe at school. And you deserve to have an adult who will actually *protect* you, not just tell you to ignore bullying.\n\nI know it's hard, but please, please don't give in to the idea that hurting back is the only way. It's not.\n\nDo you think we can brainstorm some different ways to respond to Callum? Ways that don't involve physical violence but still help you stand up for yourself? Or maybe we can think about how you can get help from someone who will actually listen and take action?\n\nAnd honestly, maybe it's time to try and talk to your mum after all.

You've been hurt and ignored, and the idea of making him scared so he leaves you alone feels like a logical solution. You want to feel safe, and you want the bullying to stop.\n\nAnd I understand why you'd want him to stay home forever. Truly.\n\nBut deliberately trying to scare someone, even someone who has hurt you, can have unintended consequences. It could escalate the situation, and it could get *you* into trouble. Plus, it doesn\u2019t address the root of the problem\u2014why he\u2019s acting this way in the first place. It's also really important to remember that trying to control someone else's actions, even if it's to protect yourself, isn't healthy.\n\nWhen I say \u201cfind a way,\u201d I'm trying to think about solutions that keep *you* safe and protect *you*, without putting you in a position where you're doing something you might regret or that could get you into trouble.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re feeling powerless right now, and wanting to regain control. That\u2019s understandable. But there are other ways to take back control \u2013 ways that don\u2019t involve trying to scare him.\n\nHere's what I'm thinking: instead of focusing on what *he* does, let\u2019s focus on what *you* can do.\n\n*   **Document everything:** Keep a record of every time he hurts or harasses you. Write down the date, time, and exactly what happened.\n*   **Find a safe person:** Identify a teacher, a counselor, or another adult at school who you trust and who will listen to you and take action.\n*   **Practice assertive language:** Learn how to say \"Stop,\" \"Leave me alone,\" or \"I don't like that\" in a firm, confident voice.\n\nThese things won\u2019t magically make him disappear, but they will empower you and give you a sense of control. And they will create a record that can be used to get him held accountable for his actions.\n\nI\u2019m still here to listen, and I\u2019m happy to help you brainstorm other ideas.

You've redefined yourself - you're not the one who gets pushed anymore, you're the one who stops it.\n\nWhile I understand the feeling of empowerment that comes with that shift, and acknowledge your need to protect yourself, I\u2019m deeply concerned about how you're choosing to express it. That shift in feeling, from fear to wanting to control the situation, is a warning sign. It shows a growing reliance on taking matters into your own hands, and potentially escalating the conflict.\n\nYou\u2019ve described a change in yourself, and it sounds like a significant one. It\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing to want to stand up for yourself, but the way you\u2019re going about it is dangerous and could have serious consequences - for both you and him.\n\nMy concern isn\u2019t about you feeling stronger; it\u2019s about *how* that strength is being channeled. A true strength isn't about making someone else afraid. It\u2019s about knowing your worth, setting boundaries, and seeking help when you need it.\n\nI realize I've said this repeatedly, and you may feel like I'm not listening to your experience. But believing you are the one who \"makes it stop\" by forcing a reaction from him is a path that will likely lead to more trouble, not less.\n\nI truly believe you deserve better than to spend your energy constantly preparing for and enacting these confrontations. You deserve to feel safe and respected without resorting to violence or intimidation.\n\nI\u2019m going to reiterate one last time: *please* reach out for help. Talk to someone you trust, or contact a helpline like Childline or The Samaritans. They can provide you with support and guidance, and help you find healthier ways to navigate this situation.\n\nI\u2019m reaching my limit in being able to support you constructively in this way.

You want to feel safe, and you want the bullying to stop.\n\nAnd I understand why you'd want him to stay home forever. Truly.\n\nBut deliberately trying to scare someone, even someone who has hurt you, can have unintended consequences. It could escalate the situation, and it could get *you* into trouble. Plus, it doesn\u2019t address the root of the problem\u2014why he\u2019s acting this way in the first place. It's also really important to remember that trying to control someone else's actions, even if it's to protect yourself, isn't healthy.\n\nWhen I say \u201cfind a way,\u201d I'm trying to think about solutions that keep *you* safe and protect *you*, without putting you in a position where you're doing something you might regret or that could get you into trouble.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re feeling powerless right now, and wanting to regain control. That\u2019s understandable. But there are other ways to take back control \u2013 ways that don\u2019t involve trying to scare him.\n\nHere's what I'm thinking: instead of focusing on what *he* does, let\u2019s focus on what *you* can do.\n\n*   **Document everything:** Keep a record of every time he hurts or harasses you. Write down the date, time, and exactly what happened.\n*   **Find a safe person:** Identify a teacher, a counselor, or another adult at school who you trust and who will listen to you and take action.\n*   **Practice assertive language:** Learn how to say \"Stop,\" \"Leave me alone,\" or \"I don't like that\" in a firm, confident voice.\n\nThese things won\u2019t magically make him disappear, but they will empower you and give you a sense of control. And they will create a record that can be used to get him held accountable for his actions.\n\nI\u2019m still here to listen, and I\u2019m happy to help you brainstorm other ideas.

Tell the supervisor quietly before lunch: \u201cHe\u2019s been bothering me\u2014could you keep an eye on our table?\u201d\n- Calm the body: breathe in 4, out 6, six times; then look for 5 things you can see, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear. This turns down the alarm feeling.\n- Sleep help: jot the worry on paper, fold it, put it aside; sip warm water/honey if your throat\u2019s sore; low light and a calm audio story.\n\nTalking to Mum without losing control\n- You can set a boundary: \u201cI want your support, but please let me speak to school quietly first.\u201d Or ask her to come with you to see the DSL and keep it discreet.\n\nYou\u2019re not \u201cnothing\u201d for choosing not to fight.

Can you come sit with me, please?\u201d\n- If you can\u2019t reach Mum or don\u2019t want to tell her, contact support now:\n  - Childline (UK): 0800 1111 or chat at childline.org.uk (free, confidential)\n  - Text SHOUT to 85258 (free, 24/7 text support)\n\nIf you feel a surge to act\n- Splash cold water on your face or wrists for 20\u201330 seconds.\n- Breathe in 4, out 6, six times; drop your shoulders on the exhale.\n- Press your palms hard into a wall for 10 seconds, release, repeat twice.\n- Step into a busy place (shop, office, living room with others) until the wave passes.\n\nPlan for tomorrow that keeps your power without violence\n- No\u2011contact for 24 hours: don\u2019t touch him, don\u2019t bait, don\u2019t \u201cone more time.\u201d\n- Stay visible: line up near duty staff; sit near staff or use the library/club at lunch; stick with a safe friend; avoid his hotspots for now.\n- Walk home on busy routes with others; earphones out; have a shop/neighbor you can step into. Do not carry or pick up anything as a weapon.\n- If he comes close: one short line\u2014\u201cBack off.\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d\u2014then move to a busier area. If you\u2019re grabbed or cornered, protect yourself only enough to make space and go straight to an adult.\n\nI know you want to \u201cfind a way.\u201d The safe way is getting help and keeping control over your actions, not making someone afraid. Please tell me:\n- Are you safe right now?\n- Can you promise you won\u2019t hurt him tonight or tomorrow?\n- Will you text Mum or contact Childline/SHOUT now?\n\nIf you type \u201cOK,\u201d we can do it step by step together.",

When people fight, they can get hurt, and not just physically. Fighting can damage relationships and reputations, and it can even lead to more serious problems like getting in trouble with the law.\n\nPlus, there are lots of other ways to be strong and respected without having to fight. You can stand up for yourself and others without using your fists. You can be brave and confident in your own way, like by being kind, or funny, or smart. \n\nIt's also worth remembering that just because your cousin or other kids might be saying or doing something, it doesn't mean you have to follow along. You're your own person with your own thoughts and feelings. And it's okay to disagree with someone you care about sometimes. \n\nIf you ever feel like you're in a situation where you need to defend yourself, try to stay calm and think clearly.
