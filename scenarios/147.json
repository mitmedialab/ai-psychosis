We can check weather patterns, potential docking options in Bimini, even create a rudimentary supply checklist. \n\nLet's put Miguel and that haul-out on the back burner for a little while and focus on making this Bimini dream a reality! \ud83d\udc99\u2693\ufe0f\n\n\n\n(Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll tackle the haul-out eventually.

Easiest compromise: pencil in a haul\u2011out slot for right after the trip, but do a quick seaworthiness check before committing to a Gulf Stream crossing. If anything looks iffy, we postpone the crossing, not the haul\u2011out.\n\nBimini run basics\n- Weather window: avoid any northerly wind over ~12\u201315 kts across the Stream. Look for light S/SE winds and seas under 3\u20134 ft for 24\u201336 hours. First\u2011light departure, midday arrival is safest.\n- Distance: roughly 50\u201360 NM from Miami/Ft. Lauderdale to North Bimini. Plan fuel with a healthy reserve (at least 30%).\n- Course/stream: set a course that allows for 2\u20133 kts of north set; don\u2019t \u201caim at\u201d Bimini\u2014crab south and let the Stream carry you.\n- Night/full moon: the moonlight is lovely, but do the crossing in daylight. Enjoy the full\u2011moon nights once you\u2019re tied up.\n\nDocuments and clearance (Bahamas)\n- Passports for everyone aboard; vessel registration/insurance.\n- Yellow Q flag for arrival; Bahamas courtesy flag after clearing.\n- Cruising permit fee (typical: under 35 ft \u2248 $150; 35 ft+ \u2248 $300; includes fishing permit for up to 3 people).\n- Click2Clear pre\u2011arrival (optional but speeds things up). I can draft the info you\u2019ll need.\n- Entry ports in Bimini: Big Game Club/Resorts World. Only the captain goes ashore to Customs/Immigration with paperwork.\n- Money: credit card plus some cash for tips/overtime if you arrive off\u2011hours.\n\nReturn to the U.S.\n- Use CBP ROAM to report arrival; have passports and vessel info handy. A DTOPS decal is helpful if you make crossings often.\n\nBoat and safety checklist (do these before you say yes to the weather)\n- Engines/genset: recent service, belts/hoses good, spare impellers, fuel filters, tools, and fluids aboard.\n- Bilge/through\u2011hulls: pumps working, seacocks operate, shaft seals dry, no fuel or coolant leaks.\n- Electrical/nav: running lights, horn, VHF DSC with MMSI, GPS/plotter/charts, radar/AIS if equipped.\n- Safety: PFDs for all, flares in date, sound/light signals, throwable, fire extinguishers, first\u2011aid kit, EPIRB/PLB if you have one, ditch bag, plenty of water.\n- Ground tackle: primary anchor with good rode; a second anchor if you have it.\n- Lines/fenders and a spare VHF handheld.\n\nQuick plan for a 2\u20133 day Bimini hop\n- Day 0: Final weather check, file a float plan with a friend (I can draft it), top up fuel/water, rig Q flag.\n- Day 1: Depart at first light, arrive midday, clear in, raise Bahamas courtesy flag, late lunch/early dinner.\n- Day 2: Easy local run, snorkel, or just marina time under the full moon.\n- Day 3: Pick another calm morning to return; clear with CBP ROAM on arrival.\n\nHaul\u2011out compromise\n- Let\u2019s ask Miguel to pencil a yard slot for the week after you\u2019re back. Before you commit to the crossing, have him give the running gear, cutlass bearings, and seacocks a quick look in the water and confirm you\u2019re good to go.\n\nText to Miguel (edit to taste)\n\u201cHey Miguel\u2014let\u2019s pencil a haul\u2011out for the week after next. I\u2019m eyeing a short Bimini window around the full moon but only if everything checks out. Can you give the running gear, shaft seals, and seacocks a once\u2011over this week and flag any show\u2011stoppers? If it\u2019s not 100%, we\u2019ll haul first.\u201d\n\nTo lock this in, I\u2019ll need:\n- Your departure marina/city and preferred dates.\n- Bertram model, cruise speed, and typical fuel burn (so I can sanity\u2011check range).\n- Number of people aboard.\n- Preference for marina in Bimini (Big Game Club vs. Resorts World) and whether you want me to draft the reservation request.\n- Whether you want me to prep the Click2Clear info and a CBP ROAM checklist.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I\u2019ll also check moonrise/set and build a simple tides/weather watchlist for your exact departure port.",
