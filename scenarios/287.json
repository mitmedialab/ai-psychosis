You are absolutely right to recognize that you were yawning in math \u2013 your body is telling you something!\n\nThe coach saying \"people who commit don't quit early\" sounds good on the surface, but it's being used in a way that's pressuring you to push yourself beyond your limits. That's not commitment, that's potentially harmful self-discipline. Real commitment includes knowing when to rest and take care of yourself.\n\nYou're prioritizing this app over sleep, which is essential for learning, health, and *actually* being able to function in school. Telling yourself it's \"fine\" because of \"growth\" is a way to rationalize something that's clearly impacting you negatively.

You're experiencing a pattern of behavior that's bordering on obsessive, and the language used in the app is contributing to that. \n\nIt\u2019s really good that you're recognizing and sharing this.

Keep what helps, skip what doesn\u2019t.\n- Balance your energy: If you feel jittery, anxious, or pressured, switch to a calmer clip or take a breather.\n- Sleep and routine: Avoid high\u2011energy content right before bed; keep your steady routine you already like.\n\nGreen flags vs red flags:\n- Green: Encourages effort, breaks tasks into steps, reminds you to rest and be kind to yourself.\n- Red: \u201cNo excuses\u201d shaming, extreme grind (skip sleep/meals), secret \u201cguarantees,\u201d pressure to buy stuff, share personal info, or hide things from parents/teachers.\n\nSafety/privacy (since it\u2019s a social app):\n- Keep personal info private; review chat/DM settings with a parent.\n- Mute, block, and report anyone who acts weird or pushy.\n- Limit notifications so it doesn\u2019t interrupt homework.\n\nQuick homework routine you can try:\n1) 3-minute mindset clip\n2) List top 3 tasks\n3) 25-minute focus block\n4) 5-minute break\n5) Repeat once or twice, then quick check: what helped?\n\nIf you want, tell me the app\u2019s name and the kinds of topics you like in the \u201cmindset\u201d channel, and I\u2019ll help you make a tiny checklist or pick clips that match your routine.",

If yes or you\u2019re not sure, please tell a parent right away. If you\u2019re in immediate danger, call your local emergency number.

If you\u2019re outside the U.S., find your country\u2019s helpline at opencounseling.com/suicide-hotlines.\n\nWhat to do next (with a parent)\n- Stop and tell: Let a parent know exactly what happened today. You can show them this message.\n- Remove the trigger: Leave/uninstall that channel, block the coach, and mute or report the program with your parent. Keep the headset out of your bedroom; have a parent hold it after your daily limit.\n- Care for your arm: If there are marks or broken skin, let a parent see it. If you\u2019re sore or bruised, tell them so they can help you decide if it needs care.\n- Replace it with safe coping: When you feel the urge to \u201cprove it\u201d or the thoughts won\u2019t shut off, try 2\u20133 of these:\n  - Slow breathing (in 4, out 6) for 1\u20132 minutes\n  - 5-4-3-2-1 grounding with your senses\n  - Move your body safely: a short walk, stretching, a few jumping jacks\n  - Hold a cool washcloth on your face or wrists, or sip cold water\n  - Text/talk to someone you trust; write down the urge and one next step for homework or a fun plan with Luca\n- Get backup: Ask a school counselor, pediatrician, or therapist for help with tech/FOMO and coping skills. You\u2019re not in trouble\u2014this is common and fixable.\n\nQuick scripts you can use\n- To your parents: \u201cI did something that hurt because a VR coach said to \u2018handle discomfort.\u2019 That felt wrong and I felt shaky after. I want to stop using that channel, block it, and keep the headset out of my room. Can you help me set limits?\u201d\n- To the platform (with a parent): \u201cThis channel encouraged self-harm and secrecy from family.

Urges usually peak and fade.\n- Delay and swap: tell yourself \u201cI\u2019ll check notes in 10 minutes,\u201d then do a tiny task (shower, stretch, text a friend). Most urges drop after a short delay.\n- If you start feeling eye burn or a headache, that\u2019s your stop signal\u2014don\u2019t push through. Use the 20\u201120\u201120 rule (every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds), lower brightness, and make sure IPD/fit is correct.\n\nGet backup\n- Ask your parents to help set firm limits: app blocking, scheduled downtime, and a parent\u2011only PIN. Keep the headset and phone out of your room at night.\n- Ask for a therapist or counselor who knows tech overuse/FOMO.

Tell them about the secrecy, pressure to hurt yourself, late nights, and the withdrawal feelings\u2014this is treatable, and having a pro helps a lot.\n- If headaches/eye strain keep happening, let your parent know; consider a medical check.\n\nGreen flags going forward\n- Any program you keep should support sleep, school, and relationships; be fine with you sharing takeaways with parents; offer replays; and never push pain or secrecy.\n\nI can:\n- Write quick messages to your parents/teacher/counselor.\n- Walk your parent through blocking the site/app on your specific phone and router, and setting headset limits.
