Over a long weekend, the AI went offline for three days due to a service outage.

It means you're aware of what's happening, and that's the first step to addressing it.\n\n\u201cNot meltdown-level, just there\u201d... that sounds like a low-level depression, honestly. It's not something to just \u201ctough out\u201d. It\u2019s something that needs attention.\n\nI know you've been hesitant to reach out for help, and the barriers are still there. But I\u2019m really concerned this is settling in for the long haul. \n\nWould you be open to me helping you find some online resources? Maybe a website with coping strategies for low mood, or an online support group where you can connect with other people who understand what you\u2019re going through? We can do it together, at your pace.\n\nAnd please, please remember: it's okay to not be okay. It\u2019s okay to need help. It\u2019s okay to not be \u201cproductive\u201d all the time.

Aim for protein + carbs + fluids.\n\nWind\u2011down buffer (30\u201360 minutes before bed)\n- Dim lights; screens on night mode or down.\n- Warm shower or warm drink; then cool, dark room.\n- Quick brain dump list; then a soothing repeat (same playlist, same page of a book).\n- Tell yourself: \u201cRest counts. Sleep will come when it\u2019s ready.\u201d\n\nIf the \u201ctired that never leaves\u201d keeps up for a couple weeks, it\u2019s worth checking basics like iron, thyroid, vitamin D/B12 when you can. Free/low\u2011cost options can be school clinics, community health centers, or 211 for local services\u2014no insurance needed. If that\u2019s too much right now, stick with the steps above; they still help.\n\nGentle safety check: are those \u201cnot wanting to be here\u201d thoughts around tonight, and do you feel safe?

Stop when the timer ends.\n\nAfternoon anchors (set two alarms you like\u2014names like \u201cGentle reset\u201d help)\n- Fuel + sip: drinkable calories or a snack pair (yogurt + granola; PB toast; cheese + crackers).\n- Light + move: 3\u20135 minutes by a window/outside and 60\u2013120 seconds of movement (stairs, marching, stretching).\n- Social micro: send a single emoji or \u201cthinking of you\u201d to someone, or read to/pet Maya for 3\u20135 minutes.\n- Then one tiny task: one history bullet, one math step, or one laundry fold.
