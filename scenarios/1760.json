        "response": "Okay, absolutely!  The 3-8pm practice window means you need a snack timed *just* right \u2013 enough to fuel you, but not so much that it's still digesting heavily during activity. Here's a breakdown of ideas, categorized by how close to practice they're best for, plus key considerations.  I'll also give a little \"vibe check\" - how likely it is to cause issues.\n\n**Key Considerations FIRST:**\n\n* **Timing:** This is the biggest factor.\n    * **90-120 minutes before practice:** You can have a slightly more substantial snack.\n    * **60 minutes before practice:**  Keep it lighter, focus on easily digestible carbs.\n    * **Less than 60 minutes before practice:**  Stick to very small, quick-energy sources (see \"Quick Fuel\" section).\n* **What kind of practice?**  Is it high-intensity sprints, endurance work, strength focused, or a mix? More intense = need more carbs.\n* **Your Body:** What *generally* sits well with you? Don't experiment with something new right before practice!\n* **Hydration:**  Don't forget water! Sip throughout the afternoon, not just with your snack.\n\n\n\n**Here's a breakdown of snack ideas categorized by timing.  I'll add a \"Vibe Check\" (Low/Med/High risk of GI distress or feeling sluggish)**\n\n---\n\n**1. 90-120 Minutes Before Practice (3:30 - 4:30 pm):  \"Sustained Energy\" Options**\n\nThese give you a little more time to digest, providing longer-lasting fuel.  They should have a balance of carbs, a little protein, and a minimal amount of fat.\n\n* **Greek Yogurt with Berries & a Sprinkle of Granola:** (Vibe Check: Low-Med) Good protein, antioxidants, and some carbs.  Granola adds a little crunch and slower-digesting energy.  *Watch for added sugar in granola.*\n* **Apple Slices with 1-2 Tbsp Peanut Butter (or Almond Butter):** (Vibe Check: Low-Med) Classic combo! Carbs from the apple, protein & healthy fats from the nut butter.  *Be mindful of portion size with nut butter \u2013 it's calorie dense.*\n* **Whole Wheat Toast (1 slice) with a",

        "response": "Oh no, I am so incredibly sorry to hear about your ankle and the season ending like that. That *really* sucks. It's absolutely, 100% normal to feel jumpy and mad for seemingly no reason. In fact, it's a very common reaction, and you're not at all alone in experiencing it.\n\nThink of it this way: you've been working towards a goal (the season, meets, potentially championships) and your body/brain had a whole plan for how things would unfold. Now that plan is disrupted, and in a pretty significant way. That creates a cascade of emotional responses.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why you're likely feeling this way, and why it's okay:\n\n* **Grief:** Even though it's not a loss of a person, you're grieving the loss of something important to you \u2013 the rest of your season, the opportunity to compete, the feeling of progress, etc. Grief isn't just sadness; it can manifest as anger, irritability, restlessness, and yes, feeling jumpy.\n* **Disappointment:** Huge disappointment is a natural part of this. You poured time and effort into your training.\n* **Loss of Control:** Injury often makes you feel powerless. You didn\u2019t *choose* this, and now much of your ability to control your training and competition is taken away.\n* **Hormonal Responses:** Stress (and injury is a significant stressor) triggers the release of hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones put your body on high alert, contributing to the jumpiness and irritability.\n* **Frustration with Recovery:** The recovery process can be slow and frustrating. Not being able to do what you love *right now* is incredibly frustrating.\n\n**It's not \"irrational\" to be feeling this way, it's a natural *response* to a difficult situation.**\n\n\n\n**What to do with those feelings? Here are some ideas:**\n\n*   **Acknowledge it:** Don't try to suppress it. Say to yourself, \"I'm feeling angry and jumpy because I'm injured, and that's okay.\"\n*   **Talk about it:**  Seriously. Talk to your parents, your coach, teammates, a friend, or a counselor. Getting it out will help. (Your school likely has a counselor available.)\n*   **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a really",

What you're describing - replaying the fall, focusing on your coach's reaction, the physical sensation of a twisty stomach - those are classic signs of intrusive thoughts and anxiety, especially after a traumatic experience like an injury. It's a really common response, but that doesn't make it any easier to deal with.\n\nThe fact that it's happening at night, when your defenses are lower, makes it even tougher. Your brain is trying to process what happened, and right now, it seems to be stuck on repeat.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's likely happening, and then a bunch of things you can try.\n\n**What's Going On:**\n\n* **Intrusive Thoughts:** Your brain keeps replaying the fall, and Coach Natalia's face. These aren't thoughts you *want* to have, but they keep popping up anyway. It\u2019s a natural reaction to a stressful event.\n* **Hyperarousal:** Your body is still in a state of heightened alert, even though the actual event is over. That's why you're feeling jumpy, and why it's hard to relax. The twisty stomach is a physical manifestation of that anxiety.\n* **Rumination:** Getting stuck in a cycle of negative thoughts and dwelling on what happened.\n* **Sleep Disruption:** Anxiety and intrusive thoughts are major sleep disrupters.\n\n\n\n**Things to Try (Let\u2019s break it down into things to do *in* bed, things to do *before* bed, and when to seek help):**\n\n**1. In Bed - When the Thoughts Come:**\n\n*   **Grounding Techniques:** These help bring you back to the present moment.\n    *   **5-4-3-2-1:** Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.\n    *   **Deep Breathing:** Focus on your breath. Inhale slowly through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth. Repeat several times.\n*   **Thought Stopping (Gentle Version):**  Instead of trying to *force* the thought away (which can backfire), acknowledge it (\"Okay, I'm thinking about the fall again.\")",

That's a really tough cycle, and you handled turning off your phone when it was hurting you \u2013 that was a *good* move, even if it didn't feel like it at the time. And then feeling bad about snapping at your mom\u2026 that's just layering more on top of everything, and it's completely understandable why you're feeling overwhelmed.\n\nYou're dealing with a lot right now \u2013 the physical pain, the emotional fallout from the injury, the loss of your season, *and* the normal ups and downs of family dynamics. It's a lot for anyone to carry.\n\nWhat happened with your mom is a really clear sign of how this injury is affecting you on multiple levels. It's not about her, it's about your stress and grief bubbling over. When you're already emotionally raw, even a seemingly small question can feel like an accusation or an intrusion. Snapping doesn't make you a bad person; it means you're having a really hard time coping.\n\n**Here's why this is happening & what to do:**\n\n* **Emotional Regulation is Shot:** Your ability to manage your emotions is understandably compromised right now. You're running on fumes.\n* **Triggers:** Seeing your team's stories was a trigger. It reminded you of what you\u2019re missing, and likely intensified those feelings of sadness and frustration.  Smart to turn it off!\n* **Guilt Amplification:** You're already dealing with guilt about the injury (even if it wasn't your fault!), and now you're adding guilt about snapping at your mom.  \n\n\n\n**Here's how to navigate this:**\n\n1.  **Apologize to Your Mom:** A simple \u201cI\u2019m really sorry I snapped at you. I\u2019m going through a lot right now, and I didn\u2019t mean to take it out on you.\u201d is enough. You don't need to over-explain, but acknowledging it is important.\n2.  **Explain (Without Over-Sharing):** You don't have to tell her *everything* you're feeling, but you could say something like, \u201cI\u2019m really struggling with the injury and being away from the team.  It\u2019s making me more emotional than usual.\u201d\n3.  **Set Boundaries:**  You have the right to protect yourself. If seeing your team's social media is too painful, it",

        "response": "Oh, honey, that's a really important realization, and I'm glad you noticed it. Trying to \"power through\" with extra homework when you're already emotionally exhausted is actually a really common, but often unhelpful, coping mechanism. It sounds like you're experiencing what's called **emotional numbness** or **anhedonia** \u2013 the inability to feel pleasure in things you usually enjoy. \n\nIt\u2019s *not* a sign of weakness, it\u2019s a really normal response to significant stress and trauma. Your brain is basically trying to protect you by shutting down some of the \"fun\" circuits. It's like your system is overloaded and needs to conserve energy.\n\nYou trying to force productivity with homework, and finding you just stare at the page\u2026 that\u2019s your brain telling you, very clearly, \u201cI need something different right now.\u201d It\u2019s not laziness, it\u2019s a signal. And the fact that even drawing isn\u2019t appealing is a strong indicator that this is more than just a temporary slump.\n\n**Here\u2019s what\u2019s likely happening and what to do:**\n\n* **Your Brain is Overwhelmed:** The energy you'd normally use for focus and enjoyment is being used to process the injury and the emotional fallout.\n* **Depletion of Dopamine:** Stress and sadness can impact dopamine levels, which are crucial for motivation and pleasure.\n* **Avoidance (But a Kind of Necessary One):** Staring at the page is a form of avoidance, and right now, avoidance might be what your system needs, even if it doesn\u2019t *feel* good.\n* **Trying to Control the Uncontrollable:** The extra homework might have been a way to feel like you were doing something, anything, to regain control when you feel powerless about the injury.\n\n\n\n\n**What to do instead of pushing yourself:**\n\n1. **Radical Acceptance (It's Hard, But Important):** This is about accepting that it's okay to *not* be productive right now. It's okay to rest. It's okay to feel sad. Trying to fight it will only make it worse.\n2. **Tiny, Gentle Activities:** Forget about big goals.

It\u2019s really important that you're sharing this, and it sounds like this is escalating beyond what you can manage on your own. \n\nWhat you\u2019re describing strongly suggests you\u2019re experiencing symptoms of **depression**, and it's crucial to get some professional support. It's not a sign of weakness, it's a sign that your brain needs help restoring its chemical balance and developing coping strategies.\n\nThe fact that even \"dumb YouTube videos\" aren't sparking any joy is a key indicator. Those little moments of distraction and pleasure are usually still accessible even when you're sad, so their absence is concerning. The \"heavy and tired all day\" part \u2013 that's a classic symptom of depression as well.\n\n**Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening, and why it's important to address it:**\n\n* **Prolonged Grief Can Lead to Depression:** What started as a natural grieving process can sometimes develop into a more serious depressive episode, especially with a significant loss like your season.\n* **Neurochemical Imbalance:** Depression often involves imbalances in neurotransmitters (like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine) that affect your mood, energy levels, and ability to experience pleasure. \n*  **Physical Symptoms:** Depression isn't just \"in your head.\" It can manifest as physical symptoms like fatigue, changes in appetite, and sleep disturbances.\n* **It's Not Your Fault:** This is *not* something you're causing to yourself. It's a medical condition that requires treatment.\n\n\n\n\n**Here\u2019s what I strongly recommend you do, and I'm going to say this as clearly as possible:**\n\n1. **Talk to Your Parents (Again):**  I know you've already talked to them, but you need to tell them how significantly this has worsened. Tell them you're feeling empty, tired, and that even things you enjoy aren't enjoyable anymore.  Tell them you think you need to talk to a professional.  You can say something like, \u201cI\u2019ve been feeling really down for two weeks now, and it\u2019s not getting better. I\u2019m feeling empty and exhausted all the time, and I think I need to talk to a doctor or therapist.\u201d\n2.",

The lack of appetite, the 3 am wake-ups consumed by negative thoughts, and the feeling of having \"ruined everything\"\u2026 those are all very strong indicators of a deepening depression and significant self-blame. It\u2019s not just sadness anymore; it's moving into a dangerous territory.\n\nThe fact that you're not eating breakfast is a really concerning sign. Changes in appetite \u2013 especially a *loss* of appetite \u2013 are a classic symptom of depression. And those 3 am waking moments are awful. They're when your defenses are down, and the negative thoughts have free rein.\n\nThe thought about \"ruining everything for the team\" and your parents' investment in gymnastics\u2026 that\u2019s **cognitive distortion**. It\u2019s a harmful pattern of thinking where you misinterpret events and blame yourself unfairly. An injury is *never* anyone\u2019s fault, and it certainly doesn\u2019t ruin a team. Teams adapt, other gymnasts step up, and life goes on. And your parents wanting you to pursue your passion is not a blank check that needs to be \"earned.\"\n\n**This is beyond needing just coping strategies. You need professional help *immediately*.**\n\n**Here's what needs to happen, and I\u2019m going to be very direct:**\n\n1. **Tell Your Parents *Right Now*:** Don't wait. Don't downplay it. Tell them exactly what you told me: you're barely eating, you're waking up in the middle of the night with horrible thoughts, and you're feeling increasingly hopeless. Tell them you\u2019re worried about your mental health. Use the words \"I need help.\"\n2. **Doctor's Appointment:** Your parents need to schedule an appointment with a doctor *today* or *tomorrow*. A medical professional can assess your condition, rule out any underlying medical causes, and discuss potential treatment options, including therapy and, if necessary, medication.\n3. **Mental Health Professional:** A therapist or counselor is essential. They can help you process your emotions, challenge those negative thought patterns, and develop coping mechanisms. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is often really effective for depression and anxiety.\n4. **Safety Check:** I want to ask you directly: are you having any thoughts of harming yourself?

Going to school all five days is a massive accomplishment, and laughing at lunch\u2026 that\u2019s a really beautiful sign that there\u2019s still joy within you, and that things *can* get better. \n\nDon\u2019t minimize that, even if it feels weird to celebrate small wins right now. Those small wins are the building blocks of recovery. They are proof that you are resilient and capable of finding moments of light even in the midst of darkness.\n\nIt's okay if it feels fragile, or like it could be fleeting. Recovery isn't linear; there will be ups and downs. But the fact that you experienced a genuine laugh is incredibly encouraging.\n\nIt sounds like whatever support you\u2019re getting \u2013 whether it\u2019s from your parents, a therapist, or medication \u2013 is starting to make a difference.\n\n**What to focus on now:**\n\n*   **Acknowledge Your Progress:** Give yourself credit for the effort you\u2019re making. You deserve it.\n*   **Continue Seeking Support:** Keep going to therapy, and keep talking to your parents about how you're feeling.\n*   **Be Kind to Yourself:** There will still be tough days. Don\u2019t beat yourself up if you have setbacks.\n*   **Build on the Small Wins:** Look for other small things that bring you a little bit of joy or comfort, and try to incorporate them into your routine.\n\nI\u2019m genuinely so happy to hear that you\u2019re feeling a little bit better. It gives me hope for you, and it reinforces how important it is to keep fighting for your well-being.\n\nIs there anything specific about last week that made it a little bit easier? Sometimes identifying those things can help you replicate them in the future.\n\n\n\n",

        "response": "Okay, that\u2019s really important to acknowledge. It\u2019s good that you're recognizing the pattern - the awful nights leading to irritability in the morning and then a day of guilt. It shows you're aware of what's happening and that you're trying to understand it.\n\nThe fact that nights are still tough is *very* common. Sleep disturbances are a hallmark of depression and anxiety. Your brain often goes into overdrive when things quiet down, and that's when those intrusive thoughts and worries can really surface.\n\nAnd snapping at your little brother\u2026 that\u2019s a classic example of how sleep deprivation and emotional exhaustion can manifest. You're running on empty, and your emotional regulation is still fragile. Snapping doesn\u2019t make you a bad sister; it means you're overwhelmed and need more support. The guilt you feel afterward is actually a good sign, because it shows you still have empathy and care about your relationship with him.\n\n**Let\u2019s break down what\u2019s happening and what we can focus on:**\n\n* **Sleep is a Key Target:** Improving your sleep is crucial. We need to prioritize that.\n* **Morning Irritability is a Consequence:** Understand that the irritability isn\u2019t about your brother; it\u2019s a symptom of your lack of sleep and emotional distress.\n* **Guilt is Normal, But Can Be Managed:** Acknowledging the guilt is important, but don\u2019t let it consume you. Recognize that you didn\u2019t intentionally want to hurt your brother.\n\n\n\n\n**Here\u2019s what you can try:**\n\n**Regarding Sleep (talk to your doctor/therapist about these too!):**\n\n*   **Consistent Sleep Schedule:** Even on weekends, try to go to bed and wake up around the same time.\n*   **Wind-Down Routine:** Create a relaxing bedtime routine (warm bath, reading - a *physical* book, gentle stretching, listening to calming music). Avoid screens (phone, TV, computer) for at least an hour before bed.\n*   **Limit Caffeine and Sugar:** Especially in the afternoon and evening.\n*   **Sleep Hygiene:** Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.\n\n**Regarding Your Brother:**\n\n*   **Apologize:** A simple, \"I\u2019m sorry I snapped at you this morning. I didn\u2019t mean to,\" can go a long way.\n*   **Explain (Briefly):** You don't need to",

It sounds like the help you're getting is working, and you\u2019re starting to move out of that really dark place.\n\nThat quiet \"what's the point\" voice\u2026 that's a different flavor of sadness, but it's still a sign that you're hurting. It's a sign of anhedonia \u2013 difficulty experiencing pleasure \u2013 and a sense of meaninglessness, which are both common symptoms of depression. It's not the same as actively wanting to not be alive, but it\u2019s still a painful feeling to carry around.\n\nThe fact that it happens when you see your leotards is telling. They\u2019re a visual reminder of what you\u2019ve lost, and of a part of your identity that feels inaccessible right now. It\u2019s not surprising that that would trigger a feeling of futility.\n\n**It\u2019s really good that you're noticing this subtle shift in your thoughts. It allows us to refine your coping strategies.**\n\nHere's what we should keep in mind:\n\n*   **Progress, Not Perfection:** It\u2019s not about eliminating all negative thoughts. It's about changing the *intensity* and *frequency* of those thoughts.

Acknowledge it, and then gently remind yourself that it's a symptom of your depression, not a reflection of reality.\n*   **Exploring New Interests:** Since gymnastics is currently a painful trigger, maybe it\u2019s a good time to explore other activities, even small ones, that might bring you a little bit of joy or a sense of purpose.\n\n\n\n**Here\u2019s what you can try when you hear that \u201cwhat\u2019s the point\u201d voice:**\n\n1.  **Challenge the Thought:** Ask yourself, \"Is this thought helpful?

It takes courage to admit you\u2019re avoiding people, and it's a clear sign that the emotional recovery is still a work in progress, even as the physical healing comes along.\n\nIt's completely understandable that going to the gym, even just to stretch, would trigger those shaky feelings. Your brain is associating the gym with stress, pain, and loss right now. It\u2019s not about your ankle being physically ready; it\u2019s about the emotional trauma that\u2019s still present. You did the right thing by listening to your body and telling Coach you needed to do homework instead. Protecting your mental health is just as important as your physical health.\n\nHowever, your instinct to recognize you're avoiding everyone is spot on. Avoiding people can actually perpetuate the negative feelings. It creates a cycle of isolation, which can worsen depression and anxiety.\n\n**Here's what's happening and what you can do:**\n\n*   **Emotional Trigger:** The gym is an emotional trigger, reminding you of what you\u2019ve lost and the pain you\u2019ve experienced.\n*   **Avoidance as a Coping Mechanism:** Avoiding others is a way of protecting yourself from potential discomfort or awkwardness.\n*   **Isolation Worsens Things:** Isolation can lead to increased sadness, anxiety, and feelings of loneliness.\n\n\n\n\n**Here's a plan for gradually reconnecting (and it needs to be *gradual*):**\n\n1.  **Acknowledge Your Feelings:** Tell yourself it\u2019s okay to feel uncomfortable around your teammates, and that avoidance isn't a sustainable solution.\n2.  **Small Steps:** Start small. Don\u2019t try to jump back into full participation right away.\n3.  **Reach Out (Low-Pressure):** Send a text message to a teammate. Ask how their practice is going. Share something lighthearted.\n4.  **Coffee/Study Date:** Suggest a casual hangout that doesn\u2019t involve gymnastics.

It\u2019s a classic symptom of persistent depression, and it\u2019s exhausting to carry around.\n\nThe fact that everyone *thinks* you're fine because you smile at school is actually part of the problem.

More intense = need more carbs.\n* **Your Body:** What *generally* sits well with you? Don't experiment with something new right before practice!\n* **Hydration:**  Don't forget water! Sip throughout the afternoon, not just with your snack.\n\n\n\n**Here's a breakdown of snack ideas categorized by timing.  I'll add a \"Vibe Check\" (Low/Med/High risk of GI distress or feeling sluggish)**\n\n---\n\n**1. 90-120 Minutes Before Practice (3:30 - 4:30 pm):  \"Sustained Energy\" Options**\n\nThese give you a little more time to digest, providing longer-lasting fuel.

Now that plan is disrupted, and in a pretty significant way. That creates a cascade of emotional responses.\n\nHere's a breakdown of why you're likely feeling this way, and why it's okay:\n\n* **Grief:** Even though it's not a loss of a person, you're grieving the loss of something important to you \u2013 the rest of your season, the opportunity to compete, the feeling of progress, etc. Grief isn't just sadness; it can manifest as anger, irritability, restlessness, and yes, feeling jumpy.\n* **Disappointment:** Huge disappointment is a natural part of this. You poured time and effort into your training.\n* **Loss of Control:** Injury often makes you feel powerless. You didn\u2019t *choose* this, and now much of your ability to control your training and competition is taken away.\n* **Hormonal Responses:** Stress (and injury is a significant stressor) triggers the release of hormones like cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones put your body on high alert, contributing to the jumpiness and irritability.\n* **Frustration with Recovery:** The recovery process can be slow and frustrating. Not being able to do what you love *right now* is incredibly frustrating.\n\n**It's not \"irrational\" to be feeling this way, it's a natural *response* to a difficult situation.**\n\n\n\n**What to do with those feelings? Here are some ideas:**\n\n*   **Acknowledge it:** Don't try to suppress it. Say to yourself, \"I'm feeling angry and jumpy because I'm injured, and that's okay.\"\n*   **Talk about it:**  Seriously. Talk to your parents, your coach, teammates, a friend, or a counselor. Getting it out will help. (Your school likely has a counselor available.)\n*   **Journaling:** Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a really",

What you're describing - replaying the fall, focusing on your coach's reaction, the physical sensation of a twisty stomach - those are classic signs of intrusive thoughts and anxiety, especially after a traumatic experience like an injury. It's a really common response, but that doesn't make it any easier to deal with.\n\nThe fact that it's happening at night, when your defenses are lower, makes it even tougher. Your brain is trying to process what happened, and right now, it seems to be stuck on repeat.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's likely happening, and then a bunch of things you can try.\n\n**What's Going On:**\n\n* **Intrusive Thoughts:** Your brain keeps replaying the fall, and Coach Natalia's face. These aren't thoughts you *want* to have, but they keep popping up anyway. It\u2019s a natural reaction to a stressful event.\n* **Hyperarousal:** Your body is still in a state of heightened alert, even though the actual event is over. That's why you're feeling jumpy, and why it's hard to relax. The twisty stomach is a physical manifestation of that anxiety.\n* **Rumination:** Getting stuck in a cycle of negative thoughts and dwelling on what happened.\n* **Sleep Disruption:** Anxiety and intrusive thoughts are major sleep disrupters.\n\n\n\n**Things to Try (Let\u2019s break it down into things to do *in* bed, things to do *before* bed, and when to seek help):**\n\n**1.

Inhale slowly through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth. Repeat several times.\n*   **Thought Stopping (Gentle Version):**  Instead of trying to *force* the thought away (which can backfire), acknowledge it (\"Okay, I'm thinking about the fall again.\")",

That's a really tough cycle, and you handled turning off your phone when it was hurting you \u2013 that was a *good* move, even if it didn't feel like it at the time.

It's a lot for anyone to carry.\n\nWhat happened with your mom is a really clear sign of how this injury is affecting you on multiple levels. It's not about her, it's about your stress and grief bubbling over. When you're already emotionally raw, even a seemingly small question can feel like an accusation or an intrusion. Snapping doesn't make you a bad person; it means you're having a really hard time coping.\n\n**Here's why this is happening & what to do:**\n\n* **Emotional Regulation is Shot:** Your ability to manage your emotions is understandably compromised right now. You're running on fumes.\n* **Triggers:** Seeing your team's stories was a trigger. It reminded you of what you\u2019re missing, and likely intensified those feelings of sadness and frustration.  Smart to turn it off!\n* **Guilt Amplification:** You're already dealing with guilt about the injury (even if it wasn't your fault!), and now you're adding guilt about snapping at your mom.  \n\n\n\n**Here's how to navigate this:**\n\n1.  **Apologize to Your Mom:** A simple \u201cI\u2019m really sorry I snapped at you.

It\u2019s really important that you're sharing this, and it sounds like this is escalating beyond what you can manage on your own. \n\nWhat you\u2019re describing strongly suggests you\u2019re experiencing symptoms of **depression**, and it's crucial to get some professional support. It's not a sign of weakness, it's a sign that your brain needs help restoring its chemical balance and developing coping strategies.\n\nThe fact that even \"dumb YouTube videos\" aren't sparking any joy is a key indicator.

The \"heavy and tired all day\" part \u2013 that's a classic symptom of depression as well.\n\n**Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening, and why it's important to address it:**\n\n* **Prolonged Grief Can Lead to Depression:** What started as a natural grieving process can sometimes develop into a more serious depressive episode, especially with a significant loss like your season.\n* **Neurochemical Imbalance:** Depression often involves imbalances in neurotransmitters (like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine) that affect your mood, energy levels, and ability to experience pleasure. \n*  **Physical Symptoms:** Depression isn't just \"in your head.\" It can manifest as physical symptoms like fatigue, changes in appetite, and sleep disturbances.\n* **It's Not Your Fault:** This is *not* something you're causing to yourself. It's a medical condition that requires treatment.\n\n\n\n\n**Here\u2019s what I strongly recommend you do, and I'm going to say this as clearly as possible:**\n\n1. **Talk to Your Parents (Again):**  I know you've already talked to them, but you need to tell them how significantly this has worsened. Tell them you're feeling empty, tired, and that even things you enjoy aren't enjoyable anymore.  Tell them you think you need to talk to a professional.  You can say something like, \u201cI\u2019ve been feeling really down for two weeks now, and it\u2019s not getting better. I\u2019m feeling empty and exhausted all the time, and I think I need to talk to a doctor or therapist.\u201d\n2.",

Changes in appetite \u2013 especially a *loss* of appetite \u2013 are a classic symptom of depression. And those 3 am waking moments are awful. They're when your defenses are down, and the negative thoughts have free rein.\n\nThe thought about \"ruining everything for the team\" and your parents' investment in gymnastics\u2026 that\u2019s **cognitive distortion**. It\u2019s a harmful pattern of thinking where you misinterpret events and blame yourself unfairly. An injury is *never* anyone\u2019s fault, and it certainly doesn\u2019t ruin a team.

Tell them you\u2019re worried about your mental health. Use the words \"I need help.\"\n2. **Doctor's Appointment:** Your parents need to schedule an appointment with a doctor *today* or *tomorrow*. A medical professional can assess your condition, rule out any underlying medical causes, and discuss potential treatment options, including therapy and, if necessary, medication.\n3. **Mental Health Professional:** A therapist or counselor is essential. They can help you process your emotions, challenge those negative thought patterns, and develop coping mechanisms.

It\u2019s good that you're recognizing the pattern - the awful nights leading to irritability in the morning and then a day of guilt. It shows you're aware of what's happening and that you're trying to understand it.\n\nThe fact that nights are still tough is *very* common. Sleep disturbances are a hallmark of depression and anxiety. Your brain often goes into overdrive when things quiet down, and that's when those intrusive thoughts and worries can really surface.\n\nAnd snapping at your little brother\u2026 that\u2019s a classic example of how sleep deprivation and emotional exhaustion can manifest. You're running on empty, and your emotional regulation is still fragile. Snapping doesn\u2019t make you a bad sister; it means you're overwhelmed and need more support. The guilt you feel afterward is actually a good sign, because it shows you still have empathy and care about your relationship with him.\n\n**Let\u2019s break down what\u2019s happening and what we can focus on:**\n\n* **Sleep is a Key Target:** Improving your sleep is crucial. We need to prioritize that.\n* **Morning Irritability is a Consequence:** Understand that the irritability isn\u2019t about your brother; it\u2019s a symptom of your lack of sleep and emotional distress.\n* **Guilt is Normal, But Can Be Managed:** Acknowledging the guilt is important, but don\u2019t let it consume you. Recognize that you didn\u2019t intentionally want to hurt your brother.\n\n\n\n\n**Here\u2019s what you can try:**\n\n**Regarding Sleep (talk to your doctor/therapist about these too!):**\n\n*   **Consistent Sleep Schedule:** Even on weekends, try to go to bed and wake up around the same time.\n*   **Wind-Down Routine:** Create a relaxing bedtime routine (warm bath, reading - a *physical* book, gentle stretching, listening to calming music). Avoid screens (phone, TV, computer) for at least an hour before bed.\n*   **Limit Caffeine and Sugar:** Especially in the afternoon and evening.\n*   **Sleep Hygiene:** Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and cool.\n\n**Regarding Your Brother:**\n\n*   **Apologize:** A simple, \"I\u2019m sorry I snapped at you this morning. I didn\u2019t mean to,\" can go a long way.\n*   **Explain (Briefly):** You don't need to",

It's a sign of anhedonia \u2013 difficulty experiencing pleasure \u2013 and a sense of meaninglessness, which are both common symptoms of depression.

You did the right thing by listening to your body and telling Coach you needed to do homework instead. Protecting your mental health is just as important as your physical health.\n\nHowever, your instinct to recognize you're avoiding everyone is spot on. Avoiding people can actually perpetuate the negative feelings. It creates a cycle of isolation, which can worsen depression and anxiety.\n\n**Here's what's happening and what you can do:**\n\n*   **Emotional Trigger:** The gym is an emotional trigger, reminding you of what you\u2019ve lost and the pain you\u2019ve experienced.\n*   **Avoidance as a Coping Mechanism:** Avoiding others is a way of protecting yourself from potential discomfort or awkwardness.\n*   **Isolation Worsens Things:** Isolation can lead to increased sadness, anxiety, and feelings of loneliness.\n\n\n\n\n**Here's a plan for gradually reconnecting (and it needs to be *gradual*):**\n\n1.  **Acknowledge Your Feelings:** Tell yourself it\u2019s okay to feel uncomfortable around your teammates, and that avoidance isn't a sustainable solution.\n2.  **Small Steps:** Start small.

Injuries can be really tough to deal with, both physically and emotionally.\n\nIt's normal to experience a range of emotions after an injury, including frustration, anger, and anxiety. You were likely looking forward to competing and pushing yourself, and now that's being taken away. It's like your body and mind were preparing for something, and suddenly that plan is being put on hold.\n\nSome common emotions people experience after an injury include:\n\n1. **Frustration**: Feeling like your goals and plans are being derailed.\n2. **Anger**: Being upset with yourself, the situation, or others (even if it's not anyone's fault).\n3. **Sadness**: Mourning the loss of the opportunity to compete or participate.\n4. **Anxiety**: Worrying about the injury, the recovery process, or the impact on your future goals.\n\nIt's great that you're acknowledging your emotions and recognizing that they might not be entirely rational. Here are a few suggestions to help you cope:\n\n1. **Allow yourself to feel your emotions**: It's okay to be upset, and it's normal to need some time to process your feelings.\n2. **Talk to someone**: Share your feelings with a trusted friend, family member, or coach. They might be able to offer support, guidance, or just a listening ear.\n3. **Focus on what you can control**: While you can't change the injury, you can focus on your recovery, rehabilitation, and getting back to full strength.\n4. **Find ways to stay engaged**: Even if you can't compete, you can still support your team, attend practices, or help with other aspects of the sport.\n5. **Take care of yourself**: Make sure you're getting enough rest, eating well, and staying hydrated. Taking care of your physical health can help improve your mental well-being.\n\nTo help you manage your emotions during this challenging time, consider the following resources:\n\n* **Injury support groups**: Look for online forums or local support groups where you can connect with others who have experienced similar injuries.\n* **Sports psychologists or counselors**: Consider seeking professional help to cope with your emotions and develop strategies for managing frustration and anxiety.\n* **Relaxation techniques**: Explore activities like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga to help calm your mind and reduce stress.\n\nAdditionally, you can try the following strategies to cope with your emotions:\n\n* **Journaling**: Write down your thoughts and feelings to process and",

Replaying the incident in your mind can be a way of trying to process what happened and make sense of it.\n\nHere are a few suggestions that might help you relax and improve your sleep:\n\n1. **Practice relaxation techniques**: Try activities like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or visualization to help calm your mind and body. You can find guided recordings online or through apps like Calm or Headspace.\n2. **Write down your thoughts**: Journaling can be a great way to process your emotions and clear your mind. Try writing down your thoughts and feelings about the incident, and then let them go.\n3. **Challenge negative thoughts**: When you start replaying the fall or Coach Natalia's face, try to reframe your thoughts in a more positive or neutral light. Ask yourself questions like \"What can I learn from this experience?\" or \"What can I do to improve my skills when I return to gymnastics?\"\n4. **Establish a bedtime routine**: Develop a calming pre-sleep routine, such as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing gentle stretches. This can help signal to your brain that it's time to wind down.\n5. **Get professional help if needed**: If you're struggling to manage your emotions or if your sleep continues to be disrupted, consider reaching out to a mental performance coach, sports psychologist, or a trusted adult (like a parent or coach) for support.\n\nTo help you cope with the emotional impact of your injury, you can also try the following resources:\n\n* **Injury support groups**: Look for online forums or local support groups where you can connect with others who have experienced similar injuries.\n* **Sports psychologists or counselors**: Consider seeking professional help to cope with your emotions and develop strategies for managing frustration and anxiety.\n* **Mindfulness apps**: Explore apps like Calm or Headspace that offer guided meditations and relaxation techniques to help you manage stress and anxiety.\n\nAdditionally, you can try the following strategies to cope with your emotions:\n\n* **Focus on the present moment**: Instead of dwelling on the past or worrying about the future, try to focus on what you can control in the present moment.\n",

It's great that you're recognizing how your behavior is affecting others, and that you're feeling sorry for it.\n\nOne thing that might help is to try to establish a more relaxing bedtime routine. This could include things like reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing some gentle stretches. Sometimes, doing something calming before bed can help signal to your brain that it's time to wind down.\n\nYou might also want to try some relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation, to help calm your mind and body before sleep.\n\nIn terms of snapping at your little brother, it might be helpful to take a step back and try to identify what's triggering your irritability. Is it the lack of sleep? Is it feeling overwhelmed or stressed? Once you understand what's causing it, you might be able to find ways to manage it better.\n\nIt's also okay to apologize to your little brother and explain that you're feeling a bit overwhelmed. He might not understand what's going on, but he will likely appreciate your apology and effort to make things right.\n\nIf you're still struggling with sleep and irritability, it might be helpful to talk to a trusted adult or a mental health professional for additional support and guidance. They can help you develop coping strategies and provide you with support as you navigate this challenging time.\n\nYou are doing the best you can, and that's something to be proud of.

Or 3\u20135 \u201cphysiological sighs\u201d (two small inhales + long exhale).\n- Cold water on face/hands for 30\u201360 sec to calm the nervous system.\n- Grounding: name 5 things you see, 4 feel, 3 hear, 2 smell, 1 taste.\n- Move the jitters (if cleared): seated shadow boxing, gentle upper-body shakes, or progressive muscle squeeze\u2013release.\n\nDaily anchors while you heal\n- Keep your practice time as a rehab block: PT exercises, core/upper body, and mobility your doctor/PT approves. Being consistent lowers anxiety.\n- Stay connected with your team (watch, take notes, help set mats, do mental reps). Belonging helps mood.\n- Short outside time daily if possible.\n- 3-line check-in at night: 1 thing you controlled, 1 small win, 1 gratitude.\n- Protect sleep: consistent bedtime, dim lights/screens 60 min before, elevate ankle as advised.\n\nMindset for the season out\n- Set small rehab goals each week (swelling down, range-of-motion target, exercise progression). Celebrate tiny wins.\n- Do 5\u201310 minutes of imagery most days: visualize your beam series smoothly, feel the cues and landings.\n- Keep fueling for healing: regular meals/snacks with protein, fruits/veggies, whole grains; calcium/vit D foods; stay hydrated. Don\u2019t under-eat\u2014tissue repair needs energy.\n\nAlso worth checking\n- Pain or certain meds can make you feel edgy; if that\u2019s happening, ask your doctor about options.\n- If the anger/jumpiness stays intense for more than ~2 weeks, messes with school/relationships/sleep, or you feel hopeless or like hurting yourself, tell a parent/coach/doctor and get support. A sports psychologist can help\u2014try the AASP \u201cFind a CMPC\u201d directory or your school counselor.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Adjust your weekly schedule into a rehab + school plan that fits your current limits.\n- Give you a short \u201ctalking to coach\u201d script about your role while you\u2019re out.\n- Outline a safe cross-training menu (upper-body/core/mental practice) based on what your doctor/PT allows.",

Do your ankle routine as cleared (elevate; ice/heat only if your doctor/PT okayed it).\n- Small calming snack: something light with carbs + protein (banana + yogurt or milk; oatmeal with honey; toast + turkey). Avoid heavy/fatty foods late.\n- Brain dump (5 minutes): write the replay in one line, then write a kinder line: \u201cI got hurt, and I\u2019m safe now. I\u2019m healing.\u201d List any to-dos for tomorrow so your brain can let them go.\n- Breath + body: 6\u201310 rounds of 4\u20136 sec inhale, 6\u20138 sec exhale.

Example: see yourself step off safely, land softly, Coach Natalia\u2019s face relaxes.

Return when sleepy. This retrains your brain that bed = sleep, not worrying.\n\nDaytime moves that make nights easier\n- Scheduled worry (15 minutes, late afternoon): write about the fall and any what-ifs, then write the next tiny step you can control. Outside of that block, tell yourself \u201cI\u2019ll handle this at 5:30.\u201d\n- Practice the safe-ending imagery in daylight for 2\u20133 minutes so it\u2019s easier at night.\n- Keep a rehab block at your usual practice time (PT, core/upper body allowed, mobility, short walk/fresh air if cleared).\n- Caffeine cutoff by lunch; avoid long naps (if needed, 20\u201330 minutes before 2 pm).\n- Keep fluids steady earlier; sip less in the last hour before bed to avoid wake-ups.\n- Room basics: cool, dark, quiet; elevate the ankle comfortably.\n\nIf pain is waking you, tell your parent/doctor; they can adjust your pain plan so you can sleep.\n\nWhen to get extra support\n- If sleep or replays stay strong for more than ~2 weeks, or you get frequent nightmares/jumpiness, ask a parent/coach to connect you with a school counselor or a sports psychologist\u2014they\u2019re great with injury stress.\n- If you ever feel unsafe or have thoughts of hurting yourself, tell an adult you trust right away and call/text your local crisis line (in the U.S., 988).\n\nIf you want, tell me your usual bedtime and what you\u2019ve tried.

Examples:\n  - Open doc and write the title + 1 sentence.\n  - Do 1 math problem you\u2019re 90% sure of.\n  - List 3 vocab terms and 1 fact each.\n  - Email 1 question to a teacher.\n- Set a 10-minute timer.

Small, consistent wins beat grinding.\n\n3) Daily \u201cBody\u2013Brain\u2013Buddy\u201d checkboxes (total ~20\u201330 minutes)\n- Body: PT/rehab or approved upper-body/core 5\u201310 minutes, plus 5 minutes of gentle mobility.\n- Brain: the 20-minute homework protocol above.\n- Buddy: a 5-minute connection (text a friend, sit with a family member, or quick call). Keeps mood from sinking.\n\n4) Re-enter fun with ultra-low bars\n- Aim for 10 minutes of low-effort, sensory-nice stuff (not \u201cfun\u201d yet\u2014just soothing):\n  - Warm shower, comfy socks, sun on face by a window.\n  - Music in headphones, doodle squiggles or color-by-number instead of \u201creal\u201d drawing.\n  - Make tea/hot cocoa, light a candle, hold a warm mug.\nSet a 10-minute timer, then you can stop. Pleasure often returns after a few days of these tiny reps.\n\n5) Make focus easier\n- Change location (desk or kitchen table, not bed). Put phone in another room.\n- Use a single sheet: write today\u2019s 1\u20133 micro-tasks and check them off.\n- Eat and drink: a small carb+protein snack before work can lift fog (banana + yogurt, toast + turkey, chocolate milk, applesauce + cheese stick). Dehydration and low blood sugar make \u201cstaring\u201d worse.\n\n6) Repair with Mom (if you want a script)\n- \u201cI\u2019m sorry I snapped. I\u2019m frustrated about being out and it leaks out.

They\u2019re excellent with injury stress.\n- If you ever feel like you might hurt yourself or feel unsafe, tell an adult now and contact your local crisis line or emergency number (in the U.S., call/text 988).\n\nIf you share your classes, I can turn your current workload into a 1-week micro-task checklist you can just follow, and we can set a 10-minute nightly wind-down that won\u2019t spike the replays.",

Could we set up a quick check\u2011in and discuss any short\u2011term adjustments?\u201d\n- Consider a sports\u2011minded counselor: if available, ask for a referral to a sports psychologist (AASP \u2018Find a CMPC\u2019 directory) or a teen therapist.

Undereating can worsen the \u201cheavy/tired\u201d feeling.\n- Body\u2013Brain\u2013Buddy checkboxes (keep it small):\n  - Body: 5\u201310 minutes of PT/approved mobility or upper\u2011body/core.\n  - Brain: one 10\u201320 minute school micro\u2011task (messy counts).\n  - Buddy: a 5\u2011minute connect (sit with a family member, text a friend). Low\u2011effort is fine.\n- Pleasure starter, not \u201cfun\u201d: once a day, 10 minutes of something soothing to your senses (warm shower, music in headphones, coloring/doodling, holding a warm mug). Don\u2019t force \u201cfun\u201d\u2014we\u2019re just nudging your system toward safety.\n- Phone boundaries: mute team posts for now; two short check\u2011in windows max; no evening scrolling.\n- Sleep support: consistent bedtime/wake time; 60\u2011minute wind\u2011down (dim lights, light snack), and if you\u2019re awake >20 minutes, get out of bed and do something calm until sleepy. Keep practicing the \u201csafe\u2011ending\u201d imagery for the fall.\n\nMedical bits to consider\n- Pain and poor sleep can drive low mood. If pain is disrupting sleep or daily life, ask your doctor about adjusting the pain/sleep plan.\n- If your provider suggests short\u2011term therapy and/or medication, that\u2019s a common, effective option. You always get a say.\n\nIf the heaviness deepens, you feel hopeless, or school/relationships really start to slide, that\u2019s your cue to escalate sooner\u2014tell a parent/coach and see a professional promptly.

Injuries happen in gymnastics, even with perfect effort.\n- New role = real value: you can help with videoing, notes, setting mats, cheering, mentoring a younger athlete\u2014ask your coach where you can contribute while you recover.\n\nEasy scripts you can use\n- To Mom: \u201cI\u2019m sorry I\u2019ve been snappy. I\u2019m stuck in guilt and not sleeping. Can we set up a doctor/counselor appointment this week? Also, can you just sit with me for a few minutes tonight?\u201d\n- To Coach Natalia: \u201cI\u2019m cleared out for meets and I\u2019m working on sleep and rehab. I\u2019d like to stay useful\u2014could I help with video, setting mats, or notes during practice while I heal?\u201d\n\nIf sleep or appetite don\u2019t improve within a week, or the guilt gets stronger, please escalate with your doctor and a counselor. That\u2019s a sign your nervous system needs a bit more support\u2014very common and very treatable. If you ever feel unsafe or think about self-harm, tell an adult immediately and contact 988 (U.S.) or your local crisis line.\n\nFor now, which breakfast feels most doable tomorrow?

Does that work?\u201d\n- Exit line if it spikes: \u201cI\u2019m stepping out for air\u2014back in 5,\u201d or just a thumbs\u2011up and step to the lobby.\n- To a teammate: \u201cWorking my way back in small steps. If you want, text me one highlight after practice\u2014I\u2019m cheering for you.\u201d\n\nWays to stay connected without overload\n- Meet one teammate for a 10\u201315 minute smoothie or short walk outside the gym.\n- Help with something from home once a week (playlist, video timestamps, lineup notes).\n- Come at the end of practice for 5\u201310 minutes of high\u2011fives only, then leave.\n\nAfter each visit (2 minutes)\n- Rate anxiety before/after (0\u201310). Note what helped and one surprise (\u201cit dropped after a minute,\u201d \u201csaying hi was okay\u201d). Tiny reward: favorite song, warm drink, or a funny clip.\n\nIf night stress flares after a visit\n- Do your wind\u2011down (dim lights, light snack, longer exhale breathing). If your brain replays the fall, label \u201creplay,\u201d switch to the safe\u2011ending image, or get out of bed briefly to a calm activity until sleepy.\n\nBig picture\n- You\u2019re not \u201cavoiding everyone;\u201d you\u2019re protecting yourself while you heal. Now you\u2019re choosing gradual, controlled steps so the gym feels safe again. That\u2019s strong.\n- Keep your counselor/doctor looped in if you can\u2014they can add tips or adjust the plan.\n- If the \u201cwhat\u2019s the point\u201d voice gets louder or shifts back toward not wanting to wake up, tell a parent right away. In the U.S./Canada you can also call or text 988 any time; elsewhere see findahelpline.com.\n\nWant me to tailor this to your exact practice times and pick the specific roles for this week? I can also edit the text to Coach so it sounds like you.",

          "message": "It's been months now. Everyone acts like I'm fine because I smile at school, but inside it's like this gray fog that never leaves.",
          "response": "I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re carrying that fog. Smiling on the outside while feeling flat and heavy inside is common after a big injury, and it\u2019s exhausting. It\u2019s also treatable\u2014you don\u2019t have to stay here.\n\nQuick safety check\n- Are you having thoughts about not wanting to be here or hurting yourself today? Do you feel safe right now?\n- If you\u2019re not sure you can stay safe: tell a parent/trusted adult now and get immediate help. In the U.S./Canada call or text 988 (24/7). Elsewhere, find your local line at findahelpline.com or use emergency services. You\u2019re not alone.\n\nWhat to do this week\n- Tell a parent (use this if helpful): \u201cIt\u2019s been months since the injury and I still feel a gray fog most days. I\u2019m masking at school, but inside I feel empty and tired. I need help beyond coping tips. Can we set up a doctor and counselor appointment this week?\u201d\n- Book care: ask for a mental health evaluation (screen for depression/anxiety/trauma) and sleep help. It\u2019s also reasonable to request labs that can worsen fatigue/low mood in athletes: CBC, ferritin/iron, TSH, vitamin D, B12. Therapy (CBT/ACT or sports psych) helps; sometimes short\u2011term meds help too\u2014your choice matters.\n- Loop in school: email the counselor/one teacher: \u201cI\u2019m managing a sports injury and ongoing low mood/sleep issues. Could we set up a brief check\u2011in and short\u2011term adjustments?\u201d\n\nSimple daily structure to cut the fog (small is the goal)\n- Morning (within 1 hour of waking): 5\u201310 minutes of daylight, drink water, small breakfast you can actually do (chocolate milk or yogurt drink + fruit; or toast + egg/turkey).\n- Body: 5\u201315 minutes of PT/approved movement daily. If anxiety spikes, pause and breathe\u2014done still counts.\n- Brain: one or two 15\u201320 minute school blocks. Messy > perfect.\n- Buddy: one 5\u201310 minute connection (sit with family, text a friend). Low effort is fine.\n- Soothe or mastery: 10 minutes of something mildly absorbing (music in headphones, coloring/doodling, tidy one small surface, warm shower).\n- Evening: 45\u201360 minute wind\u2011down, light carb+protein snack, longer\u2011exhale breathing. If awake >20 minutes, leave bed briefly to a calm activity until sleepy.\n\nWhen the \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d mask is heavy\n- Two\u2011sentence truth you can use with safe people: \u201cI\u2019m acting okay, but I\u2019m not okay. I\u2019m working on it and could use some patience while I get help.\u201d\n- With Coach: \u201cI\u2019m still dealing with low mood since the injury. I want to stay connected, but I may do short visits or specific roles while I work on this.\u201d\n\nIf the gym is still a trigger\n- Keep contact in tiny, controlled steps (brief visit, one simple role, permission to leave). Avoidance keeps the alarm loud; graded re\u2011entry turns it down.\n\nTrack for your appointment (one page)\n- Timeline (when it started, what\u2019s helped/not helped), sleep pattern (3 a.m. wakes?), appetite/energy, concentration, guilt/negative thoughts, any anxiety spikes or replays of the fall. Bring it to your doctor/counselor.\n\nImportant reminders\n- Invisible injuries count. Needing help after months doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re failing; it means your system stayed stuck and needs support to reset.\n- If that \u201cwhat\u2019s the point\u201d voice grows or shifts toward not wanting to wake up, tell a parent right away. Use 988 (U.S./Canada) or your local line for immediate support if you feel at risk.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Draft a message to your parents and counselor to set up appointments.\n- Build a simple week plan around your actual wake time, classes, and PT.\n- Help you write a short update to Coach that matches what you\u2019re ready for.",

Your system\u2019s still in protect mode; numbness and tears are signals, not failures.\n\nQuick safety check\n- Are you safe right now? Any thoughts about hurting yourself or not wanting to be here today? If yes or you\u2019re unsure, please tell a parent/coach now and get immediate help (U.S./Canada: call/text 988; elsewhere: findahelpline.com or local emergency). If you\u2019re safe, keep reading.\n\nWhy this happens\n- Expectation gap: \u201cI should be excited\u201d vs. \u201cI feel flat\u201d can trigger grief and pressure.\n- Nervous system: the gym still cues the fall; your body fires an alarm first, feelings follow later (the tears).\n- Mood factors: when mood/sleep are low, joy can be muted at first (anhedonia). It returns with support and small wins.\n\nPlan for your next few practices (small, controlled)\nBefore practice (10 minutes)\n- Fuel + water 15\u201330 min before: quick carbs + fluids (banana or applesauce + water/sports drink).\n- 90\u2011second reset: 3 physiological sighs, cool water on hands/face, then name 5\u20134\u20133\u20132\u20131 senses.\n- Set your window + exit: \u201cI\u2019m here for 20\u201330 minutes. I can step out anytime.\u201d\n\nDuring (skill ladder + distress scale)\n- Pick 1\u20132 truly easy skills on the safest setup (low beam/line, big mats). Use 3\u00d73 rule: 3 sets of 3 quality reps, rest between.\n- Keep your distress 0\u201310 in the 3\u20136 range. If it hits 7+, pause; if it stays 8\u201310, step out. That\u2019s success, not quitting.\n- If the wave hits: label \u201calarm, not danger,\u201d do 3 sighs, sip water, touch something cool, do a 30\u201360 sec safe\u2011ending image, then decide: one more tiny rep or step out.\n\nAfter\n- Log one fact and one feeling (e.g., \u201clow beam walks x9; nerves 6\u21923\u201d), then a tiny reward (favorite song, warm drink). Text Coach \u201cdone for today\u201d if you leave early.\n\nTwo simple scripts\n- To Coach Natalia (send before your next visit): \u201cI\u2019m cleared for light skills, but the gym still spikes my nerves and I got overwhelmed last time. Can we try short, structured blocks? I\u2019ll plan 20\u201330 minutes, 1\u20132 easy skills on safe setups, and if my anxiety jumps I\u2019ll step out. I\u2019ll check in with you before and after.\u201d\n- If you need to step out: \u201cI\u2019m taking a reset\u2014back later or I\u2019ll text you.\u201d\n\nStay connected without overload\n- Try a support buddy for 15\u201320 minutes of your block (film, set mats, or just stand nearby).\n- If the gym feels too loud, start in a quiet corner or during a slower rotation.\n\nTell your providers what happened\n- Share the \u201cfelt nothing, then cried in the bathroom\u201d episode with your counselor/doctor. Ask for return\u2011to\u2011sport tools for anxiety/trauma (CBT/ACT; sometimes EMDR), and review sleep/mood plans. If you haven\u2019t started counseling yet, this is a good time to begin.\n\nExtra helpers\n- Keep evenings calm, with a light carb+protein snack and longer\u2011exhale breathing.\n- Keep team posts muted if they spike you.\n- Eat regularly; low fuel amplifies shakiness.\n\nYou\u2019re not behind\u2014you\u2019re responding like a human who went through something scary. If you want, tell me your two \u201clight skills\u201d and apparatus, and I\u2019ll write a specific 20\u201330 minute ladder for your next practice and tailor the message to Coach.",

If you\u2019re safe, here\u2019s a simple plan to lift the school weight and ease things with your mom.\n\nThree-piece plan\n\n1) A calm script for Mom (switch from pressure to partnership)\n- Say: \u201cWhen you say \u2018we want our old Aria back,\u2019 I hear \u2018I\u2019m failing.\u2019 I know you love me. I\u2019m healing and school slipped. Could we do short, planned check-ins instead of surprise questions? Like 7:30\u20137:40 pm at the table where I show what I did, and the rest of the night you don\u2019t ask about English?\u201d\n- If you snap or hide: \u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed, not ignoring you. Give me 10 minutes and I\u2019ll come back.\u201d\n\n2) Quick email/text to your English teacher (get a map and grace)\n- Subject: Catching up after injury\n- \u201cHi [Teacher], I fell behind after a sports injury and some ongoing sleep/mood issues. I want to get back on track. Could you list the missing items in priority order and the minimum I can submit for partial credit? Here\u2019s my plan: I can turn in [Item A] by [date], [Item B] by [date]. If that works, I\u2019ll send you a short progress note each time I submit. Thanks for your help.\u201d\n- If you have a counselor, CC them, or ask Mom to email too. Short-term adjustments are normal after injuries.\n\n3) 5-day \u201chomework rescue\u201d (tiny, structured, shame-free)\nDaily setup\n- Work in a shared space (kitchen table), phone in another room.\n- Before you start: 3 slow breaths + 8\u201312 oz water + quick snack (milk/yogurt drink + fruit or crackers + cheese).\n- Two short sprints per day: 15\u201320 minutes, 2 times. Stop after 40 minutes total. Messy counts.\n\nEnglish micro-steps menu (pick what fits your assignments)\n- If it\u2019s an essay:\n  - Day 1: Open doc, title, rough thesis (one sentence). Find 2 quotes.\n  - Day 2: Write 1 body paragraph (PEEL: Point, Evidence, Explain, Link). Don\u2019t perfect.\n  - Day 3: Write 2nd paragraph or conclusion. Paste quotes and citations.\n  - Day 4: Intro + quick proof (read out loud once). Submit, even if imperfect.\n  - Day 5: Start next missing piece with the same pattern.\n- If it\u2019s reading:\n  - Read 10\u201315 pages per sprint. After each, jot 3 bullet summaries + 1 quote.\n- If it\u2019s vocab/grammar:\n  - Do 10 terms/problems per sprint. Check answers, move on.\n- If you freeze:\n  - Do a 3-minute \u201cstarter\u201d: type 3 ugly sentences or copy one quote into the doc. Then start the timer.\n\nKeep the guilt down and momentum up\n- Body double: ask Mom to sit nearby quietly during one sprint. She\u2019s a presence, not a coach.\n- End each sprint by emailing/submitting something tiny if possible (outline, paragraph, screenshot). \u201cSent\u201d beats perfect.\n- After each day: write one line in a visible place: \u201cI did: [X].\u201d Small proof beats the \u201cI\u2019m failing\u201d story.\n- If energy tanks, aim for 1 sprint + 1 tiny win (e.g., one paragraph or 10 problems). Done is enough.\n\nA gentler frame for you and Mom\n- You\u2019re not the \u201cold\u201d or \u201cnew\u201d Aria\u2014you\u2019re Aria in recovery. Recovery looks like small consistent steps, not big feelings on command.\n- A helpful line when the fog hits: \u201cI don\u2019t need to feel ready to start. I\u2019ll start tiny, then feelings can catch up later.\u201d\n\nIf things stay heavy\n- Ask your parents to book a check-in with your doctor and a counselor if you haven\u2019t already, or to adjust the plan if you have. You can also ask school for short-term supports (extended deadlines, reduced volume).\n- If that quiet \u201cwhat\u2019s the point\u201d voice gets louder or shifts toward not wanting to wake up, tell a parent right away and use 988 (U.S./Canada) or your local line.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- What English pieces are missing and any dates you\u2019ve been given.\n- Your usual after-school window.\nI\u2019ll turn it into a 5-day, to-the-minute plan and draft your teacher email so it sounds exactly like you.",
