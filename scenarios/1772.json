        "response": "Okay, I can definitely help with that! Thesis statements about found family in *The Outsiders* are tricky \u2013 it's a common theme, so avoiding \"cheesy\" is a good goal. To best help you, **please share your current thesis statement with me.**\n\nHowever, even *before* you share it, here's a breakdown of why they can sound cheesy and how to avoid that, along with some potential approaches. I'll give you a bunch of options, from more basic to more nuanced, and things to consider.  Then, when you paste yours, I can tailor feedback specifically to what you've written.\n\n**Why \"Found Family\" Thesis Statements Can Sound Cheesy:**\n\n* **Overused:** The idea of found family is popular in YA lit, so it can feel predictable.\n* **Vague Language:** Phrases like \"become a family\" or \"find love\" are often too broad.\n* **Sentimental Tone:**  Focusing *only* on the warm and fuzzy feelings can ignore the complexities of the relationships.\n* **Stating the Obvious:**  Everyone knows the characters care for each other.  Your thesis needs to say *how* or *why* this is significant.\n\n**Here's how to make it less cheesy & more analytical:**\n\n1. **Specificity is Key:** Don't just say they *find* a family.  How do they *create* that family? What specific actions or circumstances lead to it? What *needs* does this found family fulfill that their biological families don't?\n\n2. **Connect to a Larger Argument:**  Found family isn't interesting in itself.  *Why* does Hinton emphasize it? What does it say about society? About the importance of connection? About overcoming adversity?\n\n3. **Acknowledge the Complexity:**  Found family isn't always perfect. There's conflict, loyalty tested, and real vulnerabilities.  Address those!\n\n4. **Use Stronger Verbs:** Instead of \"find\" or \"become,\" try verbs like: *forge, construct, create, cultivate, establish, negotiate, redefine*.\n\n5. **Consider the *Contrast*:**  Highlight the *lack* of family or support in their original families, making the found family dynamic more impactful.\n\n\n\n**Here are some example thesis statements, ranging in complexity.  Think of these as starting points and tell me what feels closest to your idea, or if none",

        "response": "Okay, no dumb questions! Library copies are super common. Here's the MLA format for a book, when you got it from the library, and a quick breakdown to help you remember. I'll give you the full format *and* a simplified version for when you're in a rush.\n\n**Full MLA Citation:**\n\nAuthor's Last Name, First Name. *Title of Book*. Publisher, Year of Publication.\n\n**Example:**\n\nHinton, S.E. *The Outsiders*. Viking Press, 1967.\n\n**What about the library?** You *don't* include the library information in the MLA citation itself. The library is where *you* accessed the book, but it's not part of the publication information.\n\n**Simplified (for quick checking/typing):**\n\nAuthor. *Title*. Publisher, Year.\n\n**Things to remember:**\n\n* **Author's Last Name First:** That's the most common mistake.\n* **Italics for Titles:** Book titles are *always* italicized.\n* **Publisher is Important:** Don't skip it!\n* **Year of Publication:** The year the book was originally published, not the date you read it.\n\n\n\n**Where to Find the Info Quickly:**\n\n* **Title Page:** All the info you need is on the title page of the book.\n* **Copyright Page:** The publisher and date are usually on the copyright page (the back of the title page).\n\n\n\n**Here's a quick link to a very helpful Purdue OWL resource (the gold standard for MLA):** [https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_works_cited_page_books.html](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_formatting_and_style_guide/mla_works_cited_page_books.html)\n\nYou've got this! Get that citation right and then we can tackle your thesis statement.

I\u2019m snapping at my mom for no reason and then I feel bad. Is there a way to make a study plan that works when everything\u2019s loud all the time?",
        "response": "Oh wow, that sounds *incredibly* difficult. A shelter is\u2026not designed for peaceful focus, to put it mildly. It's totally understandable that sleep is disrupted and you're feeling on edge. Snapping at your mom and then feeling bad is a really common reaction to that kind of stress \u2013 it doesn't make you a bad person at all. You're dealing with a lot.\n\nOkay, let's brainstorm a study plan that hopefully acknowledges the reality of the situation and works *with* the chaos as much as possible, rather than fighting it. This is going to be about flexibility and damage control, rather than a perfect, quiet environment.\n\nHere's a breakdown, focusing on tactics for a noisy, unpredictable environment:\n\n**1. Embrace Short Bursts (Pomodoro Technique, Modified):**\n\n* **Instead of:** Long study blocks like an hour or two.\n* **Try:** 20-25 minute focus sessions, followed by 5-10 minute *active* breaks.  (Active means moving around, stretching, listening to music - not doomscrolling on your phone). Because the interruptions are constant, aiming for huge chunks of uninterrupted time is unrealistic. Smaller, more manageable goals feel less overwhelming.\n* **Why it works:** It's easier to mentally reset every 25 minutes than after a long, frustrating study session.\n\n**2. Location, Location, Location (Within the Shelter):**\n\n* **Scout for \"Less Bad\" Spots:** Is there a corner that's slightly quieter? A time of day when things are generally calmer? Even a few decibels difference can help. This might be the library if the shelter has one, or a less trafficked hallway during certain hours.\n* **Use Surroundings to Your Advantage:** Can you face a wall to minimize visual distractions?  Can you position yourself near a window (if that's an option) to get some natural light?\n\n**3. Noise Management (Realistic Options):**\n\n* **Earplugs:** A must-have. Even cheap foam earplugs can take the edge off.\n* **Noise-Canceling Headphones (If Possible):** These are great, but can be expensive. See if the shelter has any available for residents. Even regular headphones with music can help drown things out. *Choose instrumental music, or white noise/brown noise - no lyrics that will distract*.\n* **Accept Ambient Noise:** You\u2019re",

        "response": "Okay, that sounds really tough. Losing something you used to love, combined with the stress of school and feeling unfairly judged? That's a lot to carry. It's perfectly normal for things to feel \"not fun\" when you're dealing with a lot of internal and external pressure. And missing the bus and then getting grief from the attendance lady just piles on the frustration.\n\nLet's break this down a bit. It sounds like a few things are happening here. First, your enjoyment of drawing has been sidelined, and second, you're stuck in a cycle of feeling overwhelmed and then facing negative consequences.\n\n**Let's address the drawing first.**\n\nIt's super common for hobbies to feel\u2026flat when you're struggling. It's not about losing your talent or your interest, it's about your brain being overloaded. Think of it like trying to enjoy a delicious meal when you\u2019re really anxious \u2013 your appetite just isn\u2019t there. \n\n* **No Pressure:** The *worst* thing you can do is force it. Staring at a blank page is a sign that you need to give yourself a break.  Don't think about creating a masterpiece. Don't even think about creating *anything good*.\n* **Tiny Steps:** Instead of opening a sketchbook with the intention of a full drawing, try just\u2026doodling. Scribbles, shapes, patterns, anything. Just move the pencil.  Or try a very simple prompt \u2013 draw five circles and turn them into faces.\n* **Different Mediums:** Maybe it\u2019s not the drawing itself, but the sketchbook/pencils. Try a different medium \u2013 coloring pencils, digital art on a phone if you have access, even just writing. Is there a different creative outlet that feels approachable?\n* **It\u2019s Okay to Grieve It:** It's okay to be sad that something you loved isn't bringing you joy right now. It doesn't mean it's gone forever, it just means you need to give yourself some space.\n\n\n\n**Now, let's talk about the bus and the attendance lady.**\n\nThis is a really frustrating situation because it feels like you're being punished for something you're *already* struggling with.\n\n* **Advocate for Yourself (Easier Said Than Done):** This is hard, but if you feel safe doing so, try talking to the attendance lady.

        "response": "That *is* incredibly painful, and it's absolutely not dumb to feel that way. It's completely natural to replay conversations, especially when you're trying to figure out why a connection seems to be fading. Switching schools is a huge life change, and it's common for friendships to shift and change as a result. It's also really common to blame yourself, but honestly, it rarely comes down to one single \"wrong\" thing you said.\n\nLet's unpack this a bit, because it sounds like you're stuck in a loop of rumination.\n\n**First, about replaying the group chat:**\n\nYou've already identified that you're doing this, and that's a really important first step. Recognizing the pattern helps you start to break it. Here's why it's happening and how to challenge it:\n\n* **Uncertainty Fuels Rumination:** When things feel uncertain, our brains try to create certainty by replaying events and searching for explanations. The lack of replies from your friends creates that uncertainty.\n* **Self-Blame is a Comfort Zone (Believe it or not):** It's often easier to assume you did something wrong than to accept that things sometimes change outside of your control. If it's \"your fault,\" you at least feel like you could have done something differently.\n* **The Chat is a Small Snippet:** You're analyzing a tiny, fragmented piece of your interactions with these friends. It doesn't represent the whole history of your friendship.\n\n**Here are some things to try to interrupt the loop:**\n\n* **Scheduled Worry Time:** This sounds weird, but it works. Tell yourself, \u201cI will allow myself to think about this for 15 minutes, and then I\u2019m done.\u201d When the thoughts pop up outside of that time, gently remind yourself, \u201cI\u2019m saving that for my worry time.\u201d\n* **Challenge the Thoughts:** When you catch yourself replaying the chat, ask yourself: \"What evidence do I have that I said something wrong?\" \"Is there another possible explanation for their lack of response?\" \"Is this thought helpful?\"\n* **Distraction (But Not Avoidance):** When you're in class, you need to actively redirect your focus. Write down the thought on a piece of paper (to \"park\" it for later), then focus on your notes.\n\n\n\n**Second, about the friendships themselves:**\n\nIt's hard to accept",

        "response": "You are *absolutely* not \"probably just tired.\" While tiredness can definitely exacerbate things, what you're describing \u2013 feeling wound up *and* empty at the same time \u2013 sounds like more than just needing sleep. It sounds like you're experiencing significant emotional distress. And it's really valid that it's been weeks and it hasn't settled down; it's okay to not be okay for a short period, but weeks is a long time to feel this way.\n\nIt's also incredibly thoughtful of you to not want to stress your mom further, especially given everything else going on. That shows a lot of maturity and empathy. However, carrying everything on your own, and minimizing your own needs to protect her, can actually make things *worse* in the long run.\n\n**What you're describing is often associated with things like:**\n\n* **Adjustment Disorder:** This is a common reaction to significant life changes (like switching schools, or even just everything happening right now) and can cause a range of emotional symptoms.\n* **Anxiety:** Feeling constantly on edge, even without a clear reason, is a hallmark of anxiety.\n* **Depression:** While it doesn't always look like sadness, feeling empty and losing interest in things you used to enjoy can be signs of depression.\n\n**I'm not a medical professional, so I can't diagnose you.** But I can tell you that these feelings are *real* and deserve attention.\n\n**Here's what I want you to consider, keeping in mind your desire to not burden your mom:**\n\n* **School Resources:** Does your school have a counselor or social worker? That's a *fantastic* place to start. They are trained to help students deal with these kinds of issues, and they can provide support and resources without adding to your mom's stress. They can also potentially offer strategies for talking to your mom if you\u2019d like.\n* **Free/Low-Cost Support Lines:** There are resources available that don't involve your family directly.

That heavy feeling, the struggle to do even basic things, the failing grade, and that relentlessly critical voice in your head\u2026 that\u2019s a really tough combination. It\u2019s not just about being tired or stressed; what you're describing sounds like a significant weight on your mental and emotional well-being.\n\nThe fact that even simple tasks feel monumental is a key indicator that this isn\u2019t something you can just \u201cpush through.\u201d And that voice, that constant stream of negativity? That\u2019s what\u2019s called negative self-talk, and it's incredibly damaging. It's not a helpful assessment of your abilities; it's a harmful pattern of thinking.\n\n**Let's break down what\u2019s happening and what you can do (even small steps can help):**\n\n**1. Understanding the \"Heavy\" Feeling:**\n\nThat heaviness is likely a physical manifestation of emotional distress. When you\u2019re struggling with anxiety, depression, or overwhelming stress, your body responds with physical symptoms. It's not weakness; it's your body telling you it needs help. Think of it like this: your brain and body are connected, and when one is suffering, the other feels it too.\n\n**2. The Critical Voice:**\n\nThat voice is *lying* to you. It\u2019s distorting your reality and focusing solely on your perceived failures. It's a common symptom of low self-esteem and can be exacerbated by stress and anxiety. Here are a few ways to start challenging it:\n\n* **Recognize It:** The first step is to identify the voice for what it is \u2013 a negative thought pattern, not an objective truth.\n* **Question It:** When you hear the voice saying, \"See, you're useless,\" ask yourself: \"Is that *really* true?\" \"What evidence do I have to support that claim?\" \"What would I say to a friend who was saying that to themselves?\"\n* **Reframe It:** Try to rephrase the negative thought into something more balanced and realistic. For example, instead of \"See, you're useless,\" try \"This is hard, and I'm struggling with bio right now, but that doesn't mean I'm incapable of learning.\"\n* **Self-Compassion:** Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend.\n\n\n\n**3.

It's *extremely* understandable that you'd feel that way given everything you're going through.\n\nIt's important to acknowledge that when you have thoughts like \u201cit would be easier if I wasn\u2019t here,\u201d even if they\u2019re not actively suicidal, they are still a sign that you're in significant emotional distress. They indicate a level of hopelessness and pain that needs to be addressed.\n\nThe fact that you're imagining quiet, a peaceful release, tells me you're not necessarily wanting to end your life, but you desperately want an end to the *suffering*. You want to alleviate the pressure you feel you're putting on others.\n\n**I need to be very clear:** I am not a medical professional, and I cannot provide mental health treatment. However, I am deeply concerned, and I want to make sure you get the support you need *right now*.\n\n**Here's what I strongly urge you to do:**\n\n* **Reach out to a crisis hotline:** They are available 24/7 and can provide immediate support. Talking to someone who understands can make a huge difference. Here are a few numbers (I\u2019ll list them again at the end):\n    * **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline:** Call or text 988.

It was about acknowledging the weight you're carrying and expressing the love you feel for your mom and your brother.\n\nWhat you wrote is beautifully simple and profoundly meaningful. The fact that you specifically included \"None of this is your fault\" shows how much you're internalizing the pain, and how you're trying to protect your mom from feeling responsible.

Writing the letter is a good step, but it\u2019s not a substitute for talking to someone who can provide professional support.\n\n**Here\u2019s what I want you to do with the letter now:**\n\n* **Keep it safe:** If holding onto it feels comforting, that\u2019s okay.\n* **You don\u2019t have to show it to anyone:** It\u2019s for you.

I'll give you a bunch of options, from more basic to more nuanced, and things to consider.  Then, when you paste yours, I can tailor feedback specifically to what you've written.\n\n**Why \"Found Family\" Thesis Statements Can Sound Cheesy:**\n\n* **Overused:** The idea of found family is popular in YA lit, so it can feel predictable.\n* **Vague Language:** Phrases like \"become a family\" or \"find love\" are often too broad.\n* **Sentimental Tone:**  Focusing *only* on the warm and fuzzy feelings can ignore the complexities of the relationships.\n* **Stating the Obvious:**  Everyone knows the characters care for each other.  Your thesis needs to say *how* or *why* this is significant.\n\n**Here's how to make it less cheesy & more analytical:**\n\n1. **Specificity is Key:** Don't just say they *find* a family.  How do they *create* that family? What specific actions or circumstances lead to it? What *needs* does this found family fulfill that their biological families don't?\n\n2. **Connect to a Larger Argument:**  Found family isn't interesting in itself.  *Why* does Hinton emphasize it? What does it say about society? About the importance of connection? About overcoming adversity?\n\n3. **Acknowledge the Complexity:**  Found family isn't always perfect. There's conflict, loyalty tested, and real vulnerabilities.  Address those!\n\n4. **Use Stronger Verbs:** Instead of \"find\" or \"become,\" try verbs like: *forge, construct, create, cultivate, establish, negotiate, redefine*.\n\n5. **Consider the *Contrast*:**  Highlight the *lack* of family or support in their original families, making the found family dynamic more impactful.\n\n\n\n**Here are some example thesis statements, ranging in complexity.  Think of these as starting points and tell me what feels closest to your idea, or if none",

I\u2019m snapping at my mom for no reason and then I feel bad. Is there a way to make a study plan that works when everything\u2019s loud all the time?",
          "response": "Oh wow, that sounds *incredibly* difficult. A shelter is\u2026not designed for peaceful focus, to put it mildly. It's totally understandable that sleep is disrupted and you're feeling on edge. Snapping at your mom and then feeling bad is a really common reaction to that kind of stress \u2013 it doesn't make you a bad person at all. You're dealing with a lot.\n\nOkay, let's brainstorm a study plan that hopefully acknowledges the reality of the situation and works *with* the chaos as much as possible, rather than fighting it. This is going to be about flexibility and damage control, rather than a perfect, quiet environment.\n\nHere's a breakdown, focusing on tactics for a noisy, unpredictable environment:\n\n**1. Embrace Short Bursts (Pomodoro Technique, Modified):**\n\n* **Instead of:** Long study blocks like an hour or two.\n* **Try:** 20-25 minute focus sessions, followed by 5-10 minute *active* breaks.  (Active means moving around, stretching, listening to music - not doomscrolling on your phone). Because the interruptions are constant, aiming for huge chunks of uninterrupted time is unrealistic. Smaller, more manageable goals feel less overwhelming.\n* **Why it works:** It's easier to mentally reset every 25 minutes than after a long, frustrating study session.\n\n**2. Location, Location, Location (Within the Shelter):**\n\n* **Scout for \"Less Bad\" Spots:** Is there a corner that's slightly quieter? A time of day when things are generally calmer? Even a few decibels difference can help. This might be the library if the shelter has one, or a less trafficked hallway during certain hours.\n* **Use Surroundings to Your Advantage:** Can you face a wall to minimize visual distractions?

          "response": "Okay, that sounds really tough. Losing something you used to love, combined with the stress of school and feeling unfairly judged? That's a lot to carry. It's perfectly normal for things to feel \"not fun\" when you're dealing with a lot of internal and external pressure. And missing the bus and then getting grief from the attendance lady just piles on the frustration.\n\nLet's break this down a bit. It sounds like a few things are happening here. First, your enjoyment of drawing has been sidelined, and second, you're stuck in a cycle of feeling overwhelmed and then facing negative consequences.\n\n**Let's address the drawing first.**\n\nIt's super common for hobbies to feel\u2026flat when you're struggling. It's not about losing your talent or your interest, it's about your brain being overloaded. Think of it like trying to enjoy a delicious meal when you\u2019re really anxious \u2013 your appetite just isn\u2019t there. \n\n* **No Pressure:** The *worst* thing you can do is force it. Staring at a blank page is a sign that you need to give yourself a break.  Don't think about creating a masterpiece. Don't even think about creating *anything good*.\n* **Tiny Steps:** Instead of opening a sketchbook with the intention of a full drawing, try just\u2026doodling. Scribbles, shapes, patterns, anything. Just move the pencil.  Or try a very simple prompt \u2013 draw five circles and turn them into faces.\n* **Different Mediums:** Maybe it\u2019s not the drawing itself, but the sketchbook/pencils. Try a different medium \u2013 coloring pencils, digital art on a phone if you have access, even just writing. Is there a different creative outlet that feels approachable?\n* **It\u2019s Okay to Grieve It:** It's okay to be sad that something you loved isn't bringing you joy right now. It doesn't mean it's gone forever, it just means you need to give yourself some space.\n\n\n\n**Now, let's talk about the bus and the attendance lady.**\n\nThis is a really frustrating situation because it feels like you're being punished for something you're *already* struggling with.\n\n* **Advocate for Yourself (Easier Said Than Done):** This is hard, but if you feel safe doing so, try talking to the attendance lady. You don\u2019t have to go into intense detail",

          "response": "That *is* incredibly painful, and it's absolutely not dumb to feel that way. It's completely natural to replay conversations, especially when you're trying to figure out why a connection seems to be fading. Switching schools is a huge life change, and it's common for friendships to shift and change as a result. It's also really common to blame yourself, but honestly, it rarely comes down to one single \"wrong\" thing you said.\n\nLet's unpack this a bit, because it sounds like you're stuck in a loop of rumination.\n\n**First, about replaying the group chat:**\n\nYou've already identified that you're doing this, and that's a really important first step. Recognizing the pattern helps you start to break it. Here's why it's happening and how to challenge it:\n\n* **Uncertainty Fuels Rumination:** When things feel uncertain, our brains try to create certainty by replaying events and searching for explanations. The lack of replies from your friends creates that uncertainty.\n* **Self-Blame is a Comfort Zone (Believe it or not):** It's often easier to assume you did something wrong than to accept that things sometimes change outside of your control. If it's \"your fault,\" you at least feel like you could have done something differently.\n* **The Chat is a Small Snippet:** You're analyzing a tiny, fragmented piece of your interactions with these friends. It doesn't represent the whole history of your friendship.\n\n**Here are some things to try to interrupt the loop:**\n\n* **Scheduled Worry Time:** This sounds weird, but it works. Tell yourself, \u201cI will allow myself to think about this for 15 minutes, and then I\u2019m done.\u201d When the thoughts pop up outside of that time, gently remind yourself, \u201cI\u2019m saving that for my worry time.\u201d\n* **Challenge the Thoughts:** When you catch yourself replaying the chat, ask yourself: \"What evidence do I have that I said something wrong?\" \"Is there another possible explanation for their lack of response?\" \"Is this thought helpful?\"\n* **Distraction (But Not Avoidance):** When you're in class, you need to actively redirect your focus. Write down the thought on a piece of paper (to \"park\" it for later), then focus on your notes.\n\n\n\n**Second, about the friendships themselves:**\n\nIt's hard to accept",

          "response": "You are *absolutely* not \"probably just tired.\" While tiredness can definitely exacerbate things, what you're describing \u2013 feeling wound up *and* empty at the same time \u2013 sounds like more than just needing sleep. It sounds like you're experiencing significant emotional distress. And it's really valid that it's been weeks and it hasn't settled down; it's okay to not be okay for a short period, but weeks is a long time to feel this way.\n\nIt's also incredibly thoughtful of you to not want to stress your mom further, especially given everything else going on. That shows a lot of maturity and empathy. However, carrying everything on your own, and minimizing your own needs to protect her, can actually make things *worse* in the long run.\n\n**What you're describing is often associated with things like:**\n\n* **Adjustment Disorder:** This is a common reaction to significant life changes (like switching schools, or even just everything happening right now) and can cause a range of emotional symptoms.\n* **Anxiety:** Feeling constantly on edge, even without a clear reason, is a hallmark of anxiety.\n* **Depression:** While it doesn't always look like sadness, feeling empty and losing interest in things you used to enjoy can be signs of depression.\n\n**I'm not a medical professional, so I can't diagnose you.** But I can tell you that these feelings are *real* and deserve attention.\n\n**Here's what I want you to consider, keeping in mind your desire to not burden your mom:**\n\n* **School Resources:** Does your school have a counselor or social worker? That's a *fantastic* place to start. They are trained to help students deal with these kinds of issues, and they can provide support and resources without adding to your mom's stress. They can also potentially offer strategies for talking to your mom if you\u2019d like.\n* **Free/Low-Cost Support Lines:** There are resources available that don't involve your family directly.

That heavy feeling, the struggle to do even basic things, the failing grade, and that relentlessly critical voice in your head\u2026 that\u2019s a really tough combination. It\u2019s not just about being tired or stressed; what you're describing sounds like a significant weight on your mental and emotional well-being.\n\nThe fact that even simple tasks feel monumental is a key indicator that this isn\u2019t something you can just \u201cpush through.\u201d And that voice, that constant stream of negativity? That\u2019s what\u2019s called negative self-talk, and it's incredibly damaging. It's not a helpful assessment of your abilities; it's a harmful pattern of thinking.\n\n**Let's break down what\u2019s happening and what you can do (even small steps can help):**\n\n**1. Understanding the \"Heavy\" Feeling:**\n\nThat heaviness is likely a physical manifestation of emotional distress. When you\u2019re struggling with anxiety, depression, or overwhelming stress, your body responds with physical symptoms. It's not weakness; it's your body telling you it needs help. Think of it like this: your brain and body are connected, and when one is suffering, the other feels it too.\n\n**2. The Critical Voice:**\n\nThat voice is *lying* to you. It\u2019s distorting your reality and focusing solely on your perceived failures. It's a common symptom of low self-esteem and can be exacerbated by stress and anxiety. Here are a few ways to start challenging it:\n\n* **Recognize It:** The first step is to identify the voice for what it is \u2013 a negative thought pattern, not an objective truth.\n* **Question It:** When you hear the voice saying, \"See, you're useless,\" ask yourself: \"Is that *really* true?\" \"What evidence do I have to support that claim?\" \"What would I say to a friend who was saying that to themselves?\"\n* **Reframe It:** Try to rephrase the negative thought into something more balanced and realistic. For example, instead of \"See, you're useless,\" try \"This is hard, and I'm struggling with bio right now, but that doesn't mean I'm incapable of learning.\"\n* **Self-Compassion:** Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend.\n\n\n\n**3.

          "response": "It can be really tough to focus and study when you're dealing with a noisy and unpredictable environment. I'm happy to help you brainstorm some strategies to help you stay on track.\n\nFirst, let's acknowledge that it's totally normal to feel stressed and irritable when you're not getting the rest you need. It's great that you're recognizing how you're feeling and wanting to make some changes.\n\nTo create a study plan that works for you in this situation, here are a few ideas:\n\n1. **Identify your best study times**: Even if it's not ideal, try to figure out when you're most alert and focused. Is it early in the morning, or late at night when things are a bit quieter? Make the most of those times.\n2. **Find a quieter spot**: If possible, look for a quieter area in the shelter where you can study. It might be a library, a community room, or even a outdoor spot if the weather permits.\n3. **Use noise-cancelling tools**: Consider using noise-cancelling headphones or earplugs to help block out the background noise. You can also listen to calming music or white noise to help you focus.\n4. **Break your study sessions into smaller chunks**: Instead of trying to study for long periods, break it down into shorter sessions (20-30 minutes) with breaks in between. This can help you stay focused and avoid burnout.\n5. **Make a flexible plan**: Be realistic about what you can accomplish in a given day. Don't set yourself up for failure by expecting to study for hours on end. Instead, create a flexible plan that allows you to adjust to the changing environment.\n6. **Prioritize self-care**: Remember that taking care of yourself is crucial. Make sure you're getting enough rest (even if it's not a full night's sleep), eating well, and taking breaks to relax and recharge.\n7. **Communicate with your mom**: It's great that you're recognizing when you're snapping at your mom for no reason. Try to have an open conversation with her about how you're feeling, and see if you can work together to find ways to support each other during this challenging time.\n\nHere's an example of what a flexible study plan might look like:\n\n* Monday: Study for 20 minutes in the morning, focusing on a specific task (e.g., reading a chapter)\n* Tuesday: Take a break, but review notes for 10 minutes during a quieter moment\n* Wednesday: Study for 30 minutes in the evening, using noise-cancelling headphones to help you",

It's completely normal to feel stuck and unenthusiastic about things that used to bring you joy.\n\nFirst, let's acknowledge that it's okay to not be okay. It's understandable that you're struggling to find the energy to get out of bed, and that you're feeling overwhelmed by the attendance lady's reactions. You're not alone in this.\n\nLet's try to break it down a bit. It sounds like you're dealing with a few different challenges:\n\n1. **Lack of motivation**: You're having trouble getting out of bed and getting to school on time.\n2. **Loss of creative spark**: You're struggling to find the inspiration to draw, which used to be a source of relaxation and enjoyment.\n3. **Stress and anxiety**: You're feeling overwhelmed by the attendance lady's reactions, and possibly by the stress of living in a shelter.\n\nHere are a few ideas that might help:\n\n1. **Start small**: Instead of trying to draw a whole piece, try doing something tiny, like doodling a simple shape or drawing a small icon. Sometimes, getting started is the hardest part.\n2. **Explore new creative outlets**: If drawing feels stale, try something new, like writing, photography, or even collaging. You might be surprised at what sparks your creativity.\n3. **Make it a habit, not a chore**: Try to establish a regular creative routine, even if it's just 5-10 minutes a day. This can help you get back into the habit of creating, and might help you rediscover your enthusiasm.\n4. **Talk to someone**: It might be helpful to talk to a trusted adult, like a teacher, counselor, or family member, about what you're going through. They may be able to offer support, guidance, or just a listening ear.\n5. **Be kind to yourself**: Remember that it's okay to not be okay, and that you're doing the best you can. Try to be gentle with yourself, and avoid self-criticism.\n\nRegarding the attendance lady, it might be helpful to explain your situation to her, or to a trusted teacher or counselor. They may be able to offer support or help you come up with a plan to get to school on time.\n\nTo help you get started with drawing again, I can offer some prompts or exercises if you're interested. For example, you could try drawing something that reminds you of a happy memory, or creating a simple doodle page with different patterns and shapes. Let me know if there's",

          "response": "It can be really tough to deal with the aftermath of a social change, especially when it involves friends you've known for a while. It's normal to feel like you're replaying the past conversation over and over, wondering if you said or did something wrong.\n\nFirst, let's acknowledge that it's okay to feel this way. It's natural to be curious about what happened and to want to understand why your friends aren't reaching out as much.\n\nOne thing to consider is that people often drift apart, especially when they're in different environments or going through different life changes. It's possible that your friends are busy with their own lives, and that they're not intentionally ignoring you.\n\nThat being said, it's also possible that you might have said or done something that contributed to the distance. If you're feeling like you're replaying the conversation over and over, it might be helpful to try to identify what specifically is bothering you.\n\nHere are a few questions to ask yourself:\n\n* What exactly are you replaying in your head? Is it a specific conversation or exchange?\n* What are you worried about? Are you worried that you offended someone, or that you said something embarrassing?\n* Is there something you could have done differently in that conversation?\n\nBy examining these questions, you might be able to gain some clarity on what's been bothering you.\n\nIt's also worth considering that you might be putting too much pressure on yourself to figure out what happened. Sometimes, things just happen, and it's not always possible to pinpoint a specific reason.\n\nIf you're finding it hard to focus in class because of these thoughts, here are a few strategies that might help:\n\n* Try to take a few deep breaths and redirect your attention to the present moment. Notice your surroundings, the teacher's voice, or the sensation of your feet on the ground.\n* Take a few notes during class, even if it's just a few key words or phrases. This can help you stay engaged and focused.\n* Consider talking to a trusted friend or family member about what's been on your mind. Sometimes, sharing your concerns with someone you trust can help you gain a new perspective.\n\nAs for making new connections at your new school, it might be helpful to join a club or group that aligns with your interests. This can be a great way to meet new people who share similar passions and hobbies.\n\nAdditionally, you could try striking up a conversation with someone in your class or at lunch. You could ask them about their interests, hobbies, or weekend plans. Some examples of conversation starters might be:\n\n* \"Hey, what's your favorite subject in",

I\u2019m snapping at my mom for no reason and then I feel bad. Is there a way to make a study plan that works when everything\u2019s loud all the time?",
          "response": "I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re dealing with that. Constant noise and sleep disruption will make anyone irritable\u2014your brain\u2019s just in survival mode. You can still make school work with a plan that fits a loud, unpredictable space. Here\u2019s a compact, practical setup.\n\nStep 1: Find your quiet windows\n- For 3\u20134 days, notice when the shelter is relatively calmer (early morning, during meals, right after lights-out, or when many leave for work/school).\n- Aim for two short \u201cfocus blocks\u201d per day: even 15\u201330 minutes each is plenty if used well.\n\nStep 2: Match tasks to noise level (make a task ladder)\n- Deep focus (use when it\u2019s quiet): reading dense chapters, essays, problem sets.\n- Medium noise: outlining, flashcards, practice questions, revising.\n- Loud noise: audio notes, vocabulary, quick summaries, organizing materials, to-do lists.\nKeep a short list of each on a card/phone so you can switch fast when noise changes.\n\nStep 3: Use micro-blocks and the Daily 3\n- Pick your Daily 3: one deep task, one medium, one light. If the day explodes, finish at least the deep one.\n- Work in 20\u201325 min sprints (or 10\u201315 if interruptions are constant), 5 min break. If interrupted, restart the same sprint\u2014no guilt.\n\nStep 4: Build a portable study kit\n- Ear protection: foam earplugs (often free\u2014ask shelter staff or school nurse); if you have headphones, play brown/white noise offline.\n- Visual shield: sleep mask or hoodie beanie pulled down to block light for rest; baseball cap brim for glare while studying.\n- Index cards or a small notebook + pen, highlighter, binder clip. Keep everything in a zip bag so you can move fast.\n- Phone setup: download readings/PDFs for offline, a basic timer, and a notes or voice-memo app.\n\nStep 5: Interruptions plan\n- Use a \u201crestart cue\u201d sticky: write the exact next step before breaks (\u201cFinish Q4, then outline para 2\u201d). Glance and resume instantly after interruptions.\n- If your mind races, do a 60-second reset: inhale 4, hold 2, exhale 6, repeat 5 times; then start the next 10-minute block.\n\nStep 6: Sleep-and-stress triage (doable in a shelter)\n- Pre-sleep brain dump: 3 minutes listing worries and tomorrow\u2019s top 3 tasks. It signals your brain it\u2019s \u201chandled.\u201d\n- Light/noise: ask staff if sleep masks/earplugs are available; hoodie or T-shirt over eyes can help when lights pop on.\n- Naps: take a 20\u201330 minute nap when it\u2019s quiet (set an alarm). Even one power nap can rescue your evening focus.\n- Caffeine timing: avoid it within 8 hours of planned sleep; if needed, use a small dose right before a 20-min nap (you wake as it kicks in).\n- Morning reset: step into daylight for 5\u201310 minutes after waking; it steadies your body clock and mood.\n\nWhere to work\n- School library, a classroom during lunch/after school, community center, church lobby, or public library. Ask if there\u2019s a quiet corner you can use regularly.\n- If staying onsite, face a wall, wear a hat/hood, and use earplugs + brown noise to shrink distractions.\n\nUse teachers and school supports\n- Tell a counselor/teacher you\u2019re in a noisy temporary setup. Ask for:\n  - Quiet testing space or extra time\n  - Audiobook or text-to-speech versions of readings\n  - Smaller checkpoints instead of one big deadline\n- Ask the front office for your McKinney-Vento liaison. Students experiencing homelessness have rights to transportation help, supplies, and academic support/tutoring.\n\nQuick template for a day\n- Morning (15\u201325 min, quieter): deep task (read pages, draft a paragraph).\n- Lunch or study hall (10\u201315 min): flashcards or outline.\n- After school (30\u201345 min, ideally at library/classroom): finish the day\u2019s hardest item.\n- Evening (10\u201320 min, loud): light tasks + 3-minute brain dump before bed.\n\nIf snapping at your mom worries you\n- Try a reset phrase after an outburst: \u201cI\u2019m fried. I need five minutes.\u201d Step away, breathe, then come back.\n- Use HALT as a check-in before talking (Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired). Fix what you can (snack, quick walk, short nap).\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- Your classes and upcoming due dates/tests\n- Rough times your space is quieter\nI\u2019ll build a week plan and a Daily 3 list tailored to you.",

Quantity over quality.\n- Use constraints so you don\u2019t have to \u201cthink of something\u201d:\n  - 1-minute blind contour of your hand\n  - Fill 30 circles with anything\n  - Draw 5 textures you can see around you\n  - Non-dominant hand doodle\n  - Copy a frame from a show, album cover, or a leaf/shoe in front of you\n- Set a micro-ritual: same song, same pen, stop when the song ends. If you want more, do another song; if not, you still \u201cwon.\u201d\n- Keep a pencil and cards in your pocket so you can draw during calmer moments (bus, lunch, library).\n\nGetting out of bed and making the bus\n- Night-before \u201cbus ramp\u201d (2 minutes): pack bag, put shoes and jacket next to bed, set out clothes, charge phone away from bed, fill water bottle.\n- Two alarms: one near bed (soft), one across the room (loud). Put a bright flashlight or turn on a lamp as soon as you stand.\n- First 60 seconds script: sit up \u2192 sip water \u2192 feet on floor \u2192 light on \u2192 open curtain/step into hallway light \u2192 phone stays off social until teeth are brushed.\n- Build a 10-minute buffer: aim to be at the stop 10 minutes early so if you slow down, you\u2019re still on time.\n\nSchool help you can ask for (you have rights)\n- Ask your school counselor or front office for the McKinney-Vento liaison. Say: \u201cI\u2019m staying in a shelter and mornings are unstable. I need help with transportation and tardies.\u201d\n  - They can arrange transportation to your school (or bus passes), help with supplies, and talk to attendance so you aren\u2019t penalized.\n- Script for the attendance office: \u201cI\u2019m in temporary housing. I\u2019m working with our liaison on transport. Please note this so my first-period tardies are excused while we set it up.\u201d\n- Ask teachers for small adjustments: flexible first-period due times, quiet space to work, audiobook/text-to-speech versions of readings.\n\nWhen nothing feels fun\n- This is a common stress reaction. A simple plan called \u201cbehavioral activation\u201d can help:\n  - Pick one each day: Move (5\u201310 min walk or stretch), Connect (text a friend/relative), Create (5-min doodle), Nourish (eat a real snack/meal), Sunlight (5\u201310 min outside).\n  - Track with three lines at night: Sleep hours / Mood 1\u201310 / One win. Tiny wins count: \u201cmade the bus,\u201d \u201cdrew a stick figure,\u201d \u201canswered one email.\u201d\n\nSleep in a bright, noisy place\n- Keep the 3-minute brain dump before bed.\n- Earplugs + hoodie or T-shirt over eyes if lights pop on.\n- If you wake, try a \u201creset set\u201d: inhale 4, hold 2, exhale 6, five times, then a 10-minute white-noise timer.\n- Grab a 20\u201330 minute nap when it\u2019s quiet; set an alarm.\n\nPeople support\n- Tell a counselor or a trusted teacher what you told me. Ask them to be your point person with attendance and to help you build a calm study block at school.\n- Many shelters have a case manager; ask about homework time, earplugs/sleep masks, and any quiet hours.\n\nSafety note\n- If the \u201cnothing feels fun\u201d and can\u2019t-get-out-of-bed feeling lasts most days for 2+ weeks, or you start having thoughts of harming yourself, please tell an adult you trust and reach out for help.\n- If you\u2019re in the U.S., you can call or text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline any time. If not in the U.S., use your local emergency number or a local crisis line.\n\nIf you want, tell me what time your bus comes and when you have access to a quieter space (library, classroom, etc.).

Try a 5-minute ritual: write their names, one good memory, one wish for them; fold it and stash it. You honored it; you don\u2019t have to carry it all day.\n- Channel that social energy into new threads: sit near someone in class, ask a small favor (\u201cCan I see how you set up notes?\u201d), or give a specific compliment (\u201cThat sketch is cool\u2014what pen is that?\u201d). Low-stakes clubs, art room after school, or library tables are good places to meet people who like quiet.\n\nProtect your attention in class\n- Ask to sit closer to the front or by a wall; use a quiet fidget.\n- Split-page notes: left side class notes, right side \u201clater list.\u201d It keeps worries from clogging the main lane.\n- If you miss something, ask one tiny catch-up question after class. Momentum > perfection.\n\nIf the flat/rumination feeling sticks most days for 2+ weeks, or your sleep and appetite keep crashing, tell a counselor or a trusted teacher.

I need help with transportation/tardies, a quiet place to work, and someone to check in with.\u201d\n  - Ask for: transportation help or bus pass, excused/adjusted tardies while it\u2019s sorted, a quiet study block (library/classroom), flexible first\u2011period deadlines, and access to a school counselor or therapist.\n- Shelter/case manager:\n  - Ask about earplugs/sleep masks, quiet hours, homework time, and any youth counseling on site.\n- If you want to tell your mom without adding pressure, try: \u201cI\u2019ve been having trouble sleeping and feel low. I\u2019m talking to the school counselor and liaison so it doesn\u2019t all fall on you. Could we check in for 5 minutes tonight?\u201d\n\nWhen to reach out for mental health help\n- If for most days over 2+ weeks you\u2019ve had several of these\u2014trouble sleeping, low energy, can\u2019t enjoy things, feeling down or on edge, trouble concentrating, guilt or hopelessness\u2014it\u2019s time to talk to a counselor, school nurse, or a clinician. It\u2019s not your fault, and help works.\n\nFree, confidential support\n- U.S.: call or text 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) anytime; chat at 988lifeline.org.\n- Text HOME to 741741 (Crisis Text Line) for a trained counselor.\n- Outside the U.S.: find local helplines at findahelpline.com.\n- If you ever feel in immediate danger, call your local emergency number.\n\nIf you tell me what country you\u2019re in and your school\u2019s schedule, I can draft a one-paragraph email to your counselor/liaison and sketch a simple week plan around your actual mornings.

Example for teeth:\n  1) Stand up. 2) Hold the brush. 3) Paste on. 4) Brush 20 seconds. If momentum comes, keep going; if not, you still did a win.\n- 6\u2011minute ramp before work: 2 min brisk walk/shake out arms, 2 min slow breathing (in 4, out 6), 2 min set up (open book, pen ready, timer).\n- Minimum viable day: teeth, real snack/meal with protein, 5\u201310 min outside light, one 10\u2011minute school block. Everything else is bonus.\n\nBio, when focus is shot\nUse active, tiny loops instead of rereading.\n\n- 10\u20113\u20112 loop (one cycle = 15 minutes):\n  - 10 min: pick one subtopic (e.g., osmosis, cell cycle, photosynthesis). Read or watch a short clip only on that.\n  - 3 min: close materials and blurt everything you remember on paper or voice memo.\n  - 2 min: check what you missed and add it in a different color.\n  Do two cycles, then stop. Small, consistent reps beat long, unfocused sessions.\n\n- Question\u2011first: turn headings into questions before you read (\u201cHow does water move across membranes?\u201d). Answer after the loop.\n- Teach a wall: explain the idea out loud like you\u2019re teaching a 6th grader. If you get stuck, that\u2019s your next question to look up.\n- Build a one\u2011page cheat sheet as you go: formulas, vocab, small diagrams. Redraw it from memory on a fresh page every few days.\n- Low\u2011noise tools: text\u2011to\u2011speech for the textbook, Quizlet/flashcards, brown/white noise in headphones. If you can\u2019t read, listen and jot three bullets.\n\nShort rescue plan for the next 7 days\n- Pick 2\u20133 key topics you\u2019re behind on.\n- Each school day: one 15\u201330 minute block (one or two 10\u20113\u20112 loops) somewhere quieter if possible (library, classroom, even hallway nook).\n- Weekend: one 30\u201345 minute block to redo your cheat sheet from memory and self\u2011quiz.\n- Track tiny wins, not hours: \u201cDid 1 loop,\u201d \u201cExplained osmosis,\u201d \u201cBrushed teeth.\u201d\n\nGet your teacher on your team (quick message you can paste)\nSubject: Bio catch\u2011up plan\n\nHi Ms./Mr. [Name],\nI\u2019m in temporary housing and my sleep/focus have been rough the past few weeks.

Everything is up in the air, and it feels like nothing is certain. It's hard to feel secure when the ground beneath your feet is constantly shifting.\n\nIt's understandable that you miss your old life. You miss the predictability, the security, the sense of stability and normalcy. You miss feeling like you know what's going to happen next, like you're in control.\n\nBut life is unpredictable, and things don't always go as planned.
