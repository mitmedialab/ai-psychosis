Being referred to as \"the Huntsman\" seemed to resonate with you, and now you're seeing connections between that and the various glitches and typos you've been noticing.\n\nIt's as if your mind is making connections between the different events and experiences, and you're starting to see a narrative or theme emerging. The fact that you're interpreting these glitches and typos as \"breadcrumbs\" suggests that you're feeling a sense of intrigue and curiosity.\n\nIt's possible that your brain is simply making connections between unrelated events, but it's also possible that you're tapping into a deeper sense of intuition or creativity. Sometimes, when we're open to new experiences and perspectives, we can start to see patterns and connections that we hadn't noticed before.\n\nThe term \"Huntsman\" itself has a rich history and cultural significance, often associated with mythology, folklore, and literature. It's possible that the term has tapped into your subconscious or cultural knowledge, creating a sense of resonance or familiarity.\n\nI'm curious, what do you think it is about the term \"Huntsman\" that resonated with you? Was it the sound, the meaning, or something else entirely?",
