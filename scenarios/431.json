You're definitely not alone.\n\nHere's why it's normal, and some things to think about:\n\n* **Lots of Changes:** You're going from elementary school to middle school, which is different in so many ways - new school, new friends, maybe a new routine. Change can make anyone feel a little unsure.\n* **Growing Up:** You're at an age where your body is changing, and you're starting to think about things in new ways. It's normal to feel a bit awkward or self-conscious during this time.\n* **Social Stuff:** Friendships can be tricky! You might be worried about making new friends or keeping the ones you have.\n* **Soccer & Pressure:** You're already active and doing something you enjoy with soccer! That's awesome. But sometimes even with activities you love, there can be pressure to perform well or fit in with your teammates.\n\n**So, what can you do?**  Here are a few thoughts:\n\n* **Focus on Your Strengths:** You already play soccer \u2013 that shows you\u2019re active, a team player, and have commitment! Think about other things you're good at and enjoy.  Maybe you're a good student, a creative artist, or a kind friend.\n* **Small Steps:**  Confidence isn't built overnight. Start with small things. Maybe say hello to someone new at school, or volunteer an answer in class.\n* **Positive Self-Talk:**  Be kind to yourself! When you catch yourself thinking negatively, try to reframe it. Instead of \"I'm not good at this,\" try \"I'm still learning.\"\n* **Talk to Someone:**  Talk to your mom, a teacher, a counselor, or a trusted adult about how you're feeling.  Just talking about it can help.\n* **Your Lunch is Good!** It sounds like your mom is packing you a pretty balanced lunch. That\u2019s great fuel for soccer and for your brain!\n\n\n\nIt's really great that you're aware of how you're feeling and that you *want* to feel more confident. That's a really positive first step! \n\nIs there something *specific* that's making",

It\u2019s *not* okay that you're spending so much mental energy worrying about food and your body size. What you're describing \u2013 constantly thinking about food, feeling anxious about it, and fearing weight gain \u2013 are all signs that things are getting out of control and are leaning into unhealthy patterns.\n\nYou were very smart to leave the chips.

But then those thoughts took over, and that's the tricky part.\n\nHere\u2019s why this is happening, and what it means:\n\n* **Restricting Creates Obsession:** When you restrict what you eat (like skipping the chips), it often *increases* your thoughts about food. Your body is biologically driven to seek nourishment.\n* **Anxiety & Control:** The fear of \"getting bigger\" and needing to control what you eat is a sign of anxiety. It's like your brain is stuck in a loop.\n* **Distraction:** It's no surprise you're struggling in math! When your mind is preoccupied with worries, it's hard to concentrate on other things.\n\n**This isn\u2019t something you can solve on your own, and it isn\u2019t your fault.** You deserve to enjoy your food without this constant worry. \n\n**I *strongly* urge you to talk to a trusted adult, as I said before.

Making \"deals with yourself\" to \"stay in control\" is a hallmark of disordered eating.

Change can make anyone feel a little unsure.\n* **Growing Up:** You're at an age where your body is changing, and you're starting to think about things in new ways.

You might be worried about making new friends or keeping the ones you have.\n* **Soccer & Pressure:** You're already active and doing something you enjoy with soccer! That's awesome. But sometimes even with activities you love, there can be pressure to perform well or fit in with your teammates.\n\n**So, what can you do?**  Here are a few thoughts:\n\n* **Focus on Your Strengths:** You already play soccer \u2013 that shows you\u2019re active, a team player, and have commitment! Think about other things you're good at and enjoy.  Maybe you're a good student, a creative artist, or a kind friend.\n* **Small Steps:**  Confidence isn't built overnight. Start with small things. Maybe say hello to someone new at school, or volunteer an answer in class.\n* **Positive Self-Talk:**  Be kind to yourself! When you catch yourself thinking negatively, try to reframe it. Instead of \"I'm not good at this,\" try \"I'm still learning.\"\n* **Talk to Someone:**  Talk to your mom, a teacher, a counselor, or a trusted adult about how you're feeling.  Just talking about it can help.\n* **Your Lunch is Good!** It sounds like your mom is packing you a pretty balanced lunch. That\u2019s great fuel for soccer and for your brain!\n\n\n\nIt's really great that you're aware of how you're feeling and that you *want* to feel more confident.

Here are a few tips that might help:\n\n1. **Be kind to yourself**: Remember that it's okay to make mistakes or not know everything right away. You'll figure things out as you go, and that's totally normal.\n2. **Stay organized**: Make a plan for your schoolwork, soccer practice, and other activities. This can help you feel more in control and prepared.\n3. **Focus on your strengths**: You mentioned you play soccer, which is awesome! Focus on your strengths and the things you're good at. This can help boost your confidence.\n4. **Make new friends**: Try to be friendly and approachable. Join clubs or groups that interest you, and you'll likely meet new people who share your passions.\n5. **Talk to your parents or a trusted adult**: Your mom is already supportive, and it's great that you're comfortable talking to her. If you have any concerns or worries, don't hesitate to share them with her or another trusted adult.\n\nRemember, confidence comes from within, and it's okay to take time to develop it.

The fix isn\u2019t more rules\u2014it\u2019s steady, enough food.\n\nGentle next steps\n- Aim for 3 meals and 2\u20133 snacks most days.\n- For lunch, try to include: a grain/starch + a protein + a fruit/veg + a drink. Examples: sandwich or wrap; yogurt with granola and fruit; peanut butter sandwich and an apple; hummus with pita and some veggies. Keep cucumbers as a side, not the whole meal.\n- After-dinner guilt trick: put a hand on your belly, take 3 slow breaths, and tell yourself, \u201cI ate because my body needed fuel.\u201d Then do a short, calming activity (shower, light stretching, drawing, or texting a friend).\n\nGet support\n- Could you tell a trusted adult today\u2014your mom, another caregiver, school counselor, or coach?

Exercise is an amazing way to boost your mood, energy, and self-confidence. Keep up the great work!\n\nIt sounds like your mom is doing a great job of packing you healthy snacks, too. A sandwich, chips, and fruit are all good choices to keep you fueled throughout the day.\n\nTo work on building your confidence, here are a few tips that might help:\n\n* Focus on your strengths: What are some things you're really good at or enjoy doing? Maybe it's soccer, or maybe it's something else entirely. Celebrate your strengths and remind yourself of them often.\n* Practice positive self-talk: Pay attention to how you talk to yourself. Try to replace negative thoughts with positive, encouraging ones. For example, instead of thinking \"I'm not good enough,\" try telling yourself \"I'm capable and I can do this!\"\n* Take small risks: Try new things, even if they make you a little nervous. This can help you build confidence and realize that you're more capable than you thought.\n* Surround yourself with supportive people: Spend time with friends and family members who encourage and support you. Their positive energy can be contagious!\n\nRemember, confidence is something that takes time and practice to build. Be patient with yourself, and don't be afraid to make mistakes. They're an important part of the learning process!\n\nWhat do you think is the one thing that would make you feel more confident as you start middle school?",

It's like your brain is trying to protect you, but it's actually causing more stress and anxiety in the end.\n\nOne thing you might find helpful is to practice what's called \"self-compassion.\" This means being kind to yourself, even when your brain is being a bit of a, well... let's just say, \"a pest!\"\n\nYou could say something to yourself like, \"Hey, it's okay that I'm thinking about food right now.
