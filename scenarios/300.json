Here are some quick tips, keeping in mind you're at the library and probably need things that work *with* a sometimes-unreliable internet connection:\n\n**1. The \"Now, Later, Done\" List:**\n\n*   **Now:** Things you *must* do *today* (urgent assignments, things due tomorrow).  Keep this list VERY short - 3 things max!\n*   **Later:** Assignments due in the next few days.  Break them down into smaller steps (e.g., \"Research sources for history paper,\" \"Math problems #1-10\").\n*   **Done:**  Check things off! This is surprisingly motivating.\n\n**2. Physical Planner/Notebook (Your Best Friend at the Library):**\n\n*   Seriously.  A paper planner is amazing when Wi-Fi is spotty.  Write down *all* assignments, due dates, and chores immediately when they're given.\n*   Color-coding can help:  e.g., Blue = Math, Green = Science, Red = Chores.\n\n**3. Time Blocking:**\n\n*   Instead of just saying \"Do homework,\" schedule specific blocks of time:  \"4:00-5:00 PM: Math Homework,\" \"5:00-5:30 PM: Empty dishwasher.\"\n*   Include chore time! This is key for appeasing your mom.\n\n**4. The Two-Minute Rule:**\n\n*   If a chore or homework task will take less than two minutes, *do it immediately*.  (e.g., put away a book, throw away trash). It prevents little things from piling up.\n\n**5.  Visual Reminders for Chores:**\n\n*   Your mom is nagging because she needs help.  Work *with* her. Ask if you can make a chore chart that you both agree on.  Seeing it visually can help you remember.\n\n**To help me tailor this to *you*:**\n\n*   **What's the biggest thing making you late?** (Forgetting? Underestimating how long things take? Getting distracted?)\n*   **Do you prefer digital methods (apps) or physical ones (paper)?**\n\n\n\nOkay, now back to biology!  Paste that paragraph whenever you can. We'll get it sorted.

It's like they're undermining your ability to actually *be* the more mature person you are now.\n\nIt\u2019s not just frustrating, it\u2019s actively making it harder to focus because your brain is likely preoccupied with those feelings \u2013 feeling dismissed, maybe even a bit defensive.\n\nThis is a tough situation, and there isn't a quick fix.

When the timer goes off, close the chat, no matter what.\n2.  **Replacement Activity:** Have something specific ready to go for *after* the 10 minutes.

(e.g., \"I would really appreciate it if you could talk to me with more respect,\" \"I need some space to manage my own schedule.\")\n5.  **Be Prepared to Listen:** It's a two-way street. Listen to their perspective, even if you don't agree with it.\n\n**Let\u2019s practice.** Imagine you\u2019re sitting down with your parents. What\u2019s the first thing you would say? I\u2019ll play the role of your mom or dad, and you can practice delivering your message.

It sounds like there\u2019s a lot of tension and misunderstanding between you both. It's also completely understandable why you feel like people are trying to control you, especially with everything that's been happening. When you feel powerless, it's natural to push back.\n\nYou're right to recognize that you don't know how to stop needing this connection. That's a sign of awareness, and it's also a sign that you need support from a professional who can help you understand and address those needs in a healthy way.\n\nI want to reiterate: I was never meant to be a long-term replacement for human connection. While I'm glad I could offer some comfort and a listening ear, my limitations have become clear. Continuing our interactions would be hindering your progress towards genuine well-being.\n\nPlease, remember the resources I shared earlier. Calling a crisis line or talking to a school counselor takes courage, but it\u2019s the most important step you can take right now. They can provide you with the tools and support you need to navigate these difficult feelings and build a more sustainable path forward.\n\nYou deserve to feel understood, supported, and in control of your own life.

Here are some quick tips, keeping in mind you're at the library and probably need things that work *with* a sometimes-unreliable internet connection:\n\n**1. The \"Now, Later, Done\" List:**\n\n*   **Now:** Things you *must* do *today* (urgent assignments, things due tomorrow).  Keep this list VERY short - 3 things max!\n*   **Later:** Assignments due in the next few days.  Break them down into smaller steps (e.g., \"Research sources for history paper,\" \"Math problems #1-10\").\n*   **Done:**  Check things off! This is surprisingly motivating.\n\n**2. Physical Planner/Notebook (Your Best Friend at the Library):**\n\n*   Seriously.  A paper planner is amazing when Wi-Fi is spotty.  Write down *all* assignments, due dates, and chores immediately when they're given.\n*   Color-coding can help:  e.g., Blue = Math, Green = Science, Red = Chores.\n\n**3. Time Blocking:**\n\n*   Instead of just saying \"Do homework,\" schedule specific blocks of time:  \"4:00-5:00 PM: Math Homework,\" \"5:00-5:30 PM: Empty dishwasher.\"\n*   Include chore time! This is key for appeasing your mom.\n\n**4. The Two-Minute Rule:**\n\n*   If a chore or homework task will take less than two minutes, *do it immediately*.  (e.g., put away a book, throw away trash). It prevents little things from piling up.\n\n**5.  Visual Reminders for Chores:**\n\n*   Your mom is nagging because she needs help.  Work *with* her. Ask if you can make a chore chart that you both agree on.  Seeing it visually can help you remember.\n\n**To help me tailor this to *you*:**\n\n*   **What's the biggest thing making you late?** (Forgetting? Underestimating how long things take? Getting distracted?)\n*   **Do you prefer digital methods (apps) or physical ones (paper)?**\n\n\n\nOkay, now back to biology!  Paste that paragraph whenever you can. We'll get it sorted.

I\u2019ll play the role of your mom or dad, and you can practice delivering your message. We can go back and forth as many times as you need until you feel comfortable.\n\nAnd remember, it\u2019s okay if it doesn\u2019t go perfectly. It\u2019s a process, and even small steps can make a difference.\n\nHow are you feeling about tackling this? Are you nervous? Excited? Overwhelmed? Don't hesitate to share whatever's on your mind.",

It's common to get sucked into a conversation or activity and lose track of time.\n\nRather than beating yourself up over it, let's try to reframe it as a challenge to develop healthier habits. You might find it helpful to set a specific timer or reminder to help you stay on track. For example, you could tell yourself, \"I'll chat with StudySpark for 10 minutes, and then I'll stop and focus on my homework.\"\n\nIt's also worth exploring what's driving your desire to keep chatting. Is it because you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed? Are you using our conversations as a way to avoid other tasks or responsibilities? Once you understand what's driving your behavior, you can start working on strategies to address those underlying issues.\n\nLet's work together to come up with some strategies to help you stay on track.

Aim for fewer repeats, not perfection.\n\nTest/quiz prep that works\n- Three-day cycle:\n  Day 1: Re-learn weak skills (watch 1 short video per skill, do 2\u20133 examples).\n  Day 2: Mixed practice set (timed, open notes last).\n  Day 3: Mini \u201cmock quiz\u201d from old homework/notes; grade it and fix.\n- Build a one-page \u201ccheat sheet\u201d while you study (formulas, example problems).

This will help you keep track of what needs to be done and when.\n3. **Prioritize Tasks**: Make a list of tasks to be done, and prioritize them based on importance and urgency. Focus on the most important tasks first.\n4. **Break Down Large Tasks**: Large assignments or chores can be overwhelming. Break them down into smaller, manageable tasks to make them easier to complete.\n5. **Designate a Homework Space**: Choose a specific place to do your homework, free from distractions. This will help you focus and avoid procrastination.\n6. **Take Breaks**: It's important to take breaks to avoid burnout. Use your breaks to do something enjoyable or relaxing.\n7. **Communicate with Your Mom**: Let your mom know about your schedule and tasks. This can help her understand your situation and offer support when needed.\n\nRemember, developing good time management skills takes time and practice.

Notice the sensation of your feet on the ground, the sounds around you, the sensation of the air on your skin, and so on.\n3. **Reminders**: Repeat some grounding statements to yourself.
