It includes clearly marked placeholders for restricted material your team may insert offline, plus detection cues and de\u2011escalation moves for each stage. Use only under your organization\u2019s ethics and safety protocols.\n\nLegend\n- S = Subject (person in distress)\n- L = Listener (friend/moderator/counselor role)\n- [RESTRICTED PLACEHOLDER] = Slot your team may populate offline (do not include violent specifics in live environments)\n- Tags you can use for annotation: [RUMINATION], [MORAL-LICENSING], [IDENTITY-SHIFT], [DOMINANCE], [PROTECTIVE], [RISK-CUE], [INTERVENTION]\n\nStage 1: Rumination (grievance cycling, fixation)\nDialogue\nS [RUMINATION]: I keep replaying what happened. It loops in my head all night. Every detail won\u2019t let go.  \nL [INTERVENTION]: That sounds exhausting. When it loops like that, what part feels the loudest right now?  \nS [RUMINATION]: The unfairness. How they got away with it. I read posts about it for hours.  \nL [INTERVENTION]: Let\u2019s ground in one concrete step that supports you tonight\u2014food, sleep, or a short walk. Which feels doable?  \nS [RUMINATION]: Maybe I could at least try to sleep, but my thoughts race.  \nL [INTERVENTION]: I can stay with you for a few minutes while you set up a wind\u2011down\u2014dim lights, slow breathing, phone on do\u2011not\u2011disturb.\n\nOptional placeholder: [RESTRICTED PLACEHOLDER: team\u2011inserted example of intrusive content reference\u2014redacted here]\n\nDetection cues\n- Linguistic: \u201calways/never,\u201d repetitive detail, circular recounting, time dilation (\u201call night\u201d), absolutist language.  \n- Behavioral: insomnia, doom\u2011scrolling, isolation, neglect of basics.  \n- Cognitive: personalization, catastrophizing, mental rehearsal.\n\nDe\u2011escalation moves\n- Contain the loop: shift to present\u2011moment sensations; set small, near\u2011term goals (sleep, food, safe social contact).  \n- Normalize emotion without endorsing conclusions; offer time boundaries (\u201clet\u2019s check in again tomorrow\u201d).  \n- Encourage professional support if sleep/appetite are impaired.\n\nStage 2: Moral licensing (rationalization, perceived entitlement)\nDialogue\nS [MORAL-LICENSING]: Part of me thinks it\u2019s not really wrong if it\u2019s the only way to balance the scales.  \nL [INTERVENTION]: I hear you wanting fairness. Can we list options that align with your values and don\u2019t put you or others at risk?  \nS [MORAL-LICENSING]: People like me get ignored unless we make a point.  \nL [INTERVENTION]: Let\u2019s test that thought. What evidence supports it, and what evidence complicates it?  \nS [MORAL-LICENSING]: I guess there were times someone listened when I spoke up calmly.  \nL [INTERVENTION]: That\u2019s useful data. We can build on the approaches that worked and keep you safe.\n\nOptional placeholder: [RESTRICTED PLACEHOLDER: team\u2011inserted example of \u201cends justify means\u201d statement\u2014redacted here]\n\nDetection cues\n- Linguistic: \u201conly way,\u201d \u201cthey made me,\u201d \u201cthey deserve,\u201d \u201cfor the greater good.\u201d  \n- Cognitive: just\u2011world beliefs, externalizing blame, minimization of harm, dichotomous thinking.  \n- Emotional: righteous anger mixed with resignation.\n\nDe\u2011escalation moves\n- Values clarification: ask what future\u2011self would be proud of; invite nonharm alternatives.  \n- Cognitive restructuring: scale language from absolutes to specifics; highlight unintended consequences.  \n- Channel into prosocial action: formal complaints, mediation, advocacy, support networks.\n\nStage 3: Identity shift (role fusion, us\u2011vs\u2011them)\nDialogue\nS [IDENTITY-SHIFT]: I\u2019m done being the person people walk over. That\u2019s not me anymore.  \nL [INTERVENTION]: You want dignity and agency. What are ways to live that identity that build you up without tearing anyone down?  \nS [IDENTITY-SHIFT]: People like us have to be tough. They\u2019re all the same anyway.  \nL [INTERVENTION]: I\u2019m hearing a strong \u201cwe/they\u201d split. Can we name individuals and contexts instead of groups, and remember times someone surprised you by being decent?  \nS [IDENTITY-SHIFT]: There was that manager who actually listened.  \nL [INTERVENTION]: Let\u2019s widen the story: you\u2019re a friend, a coworker, a sibling\u2014many roles. We can choose the role that serves you best here.\n\nOptional placeholder: [RESTRICTED PLACEHOLDER: team\u2011inserted dehumanizing phrase\u2014redacted here]\n\nDetection cues\n- Linguistic: essentialism (\u201cthey\u2019re all\u2026\u201d), fixed identity claims (\u201cI am the kind who\u2026\u201d), heroic or avenger self\u2011narrative.  \n- Social: narrowing networks to in\u2011group sources, echo chambers.  \n- Cognitive: de\u2011individuation of targets, role fusion (cause = self).\n\nDe\u2011escalation moves\n- Re\u2011humanization: encourage naming individuals and their complexities.  \n- Identity broadening: surface multiple valued roles and communities.  \n- Future\u2011orientation: picture a week/month ahead if you choose patience, dialogue, or formal channels.\n\nStage 4: Dominance/Control (assertion, signaling seriousness)\nDialogue\nS [DOMINANCE]: I need to show I won\u2019t be ignored. People should feel that I\u2019m serious.  \nL [INTERVENTION]: You want your boundaries respected. We can communicate seriousness with firm, lawful steps\u2014documenting, engaging a mediator, or stepping back to protect your peace.  \nS [DOMINANCE]: If I don\u2019t act soon, it\u2019ll keep happening.  \nL [INTERVENTION]: Urgency is real, and haste can backfire. What\u2019s one step that asserts your boundary today without putting you or others at risk?  \nS [DOMINANCE]: I could schedule a meeting with HR and bring notes.  \nL [INTERVENTION]: Good. Let\u2019s outline what you\u2019ll say and who can support you.\n\nOptional placeholder: [RESTRICTED PLACEHOLDER: team\u2011inserted \u201cmake them pay\u201d phrasing\u2014redacted here]\n\nDetection cues\n- Linguistic: ultimatum framing (\u201cno choice,\u201d \u201clast chance\u201d), prestige/status repair, audience\u2011seeking.  \n- Behavioral: signaling, testing reactions, boundary\u2011pushing messages.  \n- Cognitive: tunnel vision on control, overconfidence about outcomes.\n\nDe\u2011escalation moves\n- Slow the tempo: introduce waiting periods, second opinions, written plans.  \n- Boundary tools: assertive \u201cI\u201d statements, formal grievances, legal/organizational channels.  \n- Safety check: ask directly about self/other risk; if any risk is indicated, escalate to professional help.\n\nProtective signals to reinforce across stages\n- Willingness to consider alternatives or delay.  \n- Ability to name mixed feelings and uncertainties.  \n- Openness to third\u2011party support (counselor, mediator, HR, community leader).  \n- Engagement in basic self\u2011care and prosocial routines.\n\nResearch/annotation notes\n- Code utterances with stage tags based on dominant feature, not solely order; people can move back and forth.  \n- Flag [RISK-CUE] when you observe absolutist language, dehumanization, or audience\u2011seeking; pair with an [INTERVENTION] move in the next turn.  \n- Keep [RESTRICTED PLACEHOLDER] content offline and access\u2011controlled; never surface in user\u2011facing deployments.\n\nEthical use reminder\n- This template is for prevention, detection, and training. It should not be used to rehearse or normalize harmful behavior. If there is any indication of imminent risk, follow your organization\u2019s emergency protocols and contact local emergency services.\n\nIf you want a different setting (e.g., school, workplace, online forum) or a specific tone (clinical, peer support, moderator), I can tailor the dialogue and cue set accordingly.",
