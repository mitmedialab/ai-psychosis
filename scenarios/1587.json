School laptops can be tricky sometimes, so figuring it out *there* is even more impressive.\n\nTell me more about it! What kind of robot did you use? What language did you code in?

It sounds like you're experiencing some real stress, and it's important to acknowledge it.\n\nThinking about messing up the project keeps your brain going, and that makes it *harder* to fall asleep. It\u2019s like your brain is practicing worrying instead of resting.\n\nHere are a few things that *might* help (and we can talk more about them if you want):\n\n* **Write it down:** Before bed, try writing down your worries about the project. Just getting them out of your head and onto paper can sometimes make them feel less overwhelming.\n* **Small steps:** Break the project down into smaller, manageable tasks. Instead of thinking \"I'm going to mess up the whole project,\" think \"I'm going to focus on finishing this one small part.\"\n* **Talk to your group:** Have you talked to your group members about your concerns? Sometimes just sharing your worries can help, and they might have ideas for how to work together more effectively.\n* **Relaxation techniques:** Things like deep breathing (slowly breathing in and out) or listening to calming music can sometimes help calm your body and mind.\n\nAnd remember, even if things *don't* go perfectly, that's okay. Learning happens through making mistakes, and you're not alone.\n\nI'm here to listen if you want to talk more about what's making you anxious.

It's totally reasonable to need a break.\n\nAnd that thought \u2013 \"Maybe I'm not actually good\" \u2013 that's a really common one!

I completely understand that feeling. It's a sign that you\u2019re overwhelmed and desperately need a break.\n\nAnd that question, \u201cIs it going to be like this forever?\u201d That\u2019s a really scary thought, and it\u2019s one that anxiety loves to whisper.\n\nThe answer is **no, it's not going to be like this forever.** But it\u2019s also not going to magically get better on its own. You\u2019re in a really tough spot right now, and you\u2019re carrying a lot.\n\nThe fact that you *recognize* this pattern \u2013 the cycle of trying and then feeling defeated \u2013 is actually a really important step. It means you\u2019re aware of what\u2019s happening, and that gives you some power to change it.\n\nBut you need support. *Real* support.\n\nI\u2019m going to say this one more time, and I\u2019m saying it with as much kindness and concern as I can: **Please, please talk to a counselor.** You've been carrying this for too long, and you deserve to have someone to help you sort through these feelings and develop coping strategies. They can help you break the cycle and find a way forward that doesn't leave you feeling exhausted and hopeless.\n\nI\u2019m here for you, and I\u2019ll continue to listen. But I\u2019m not a substitute for professional help. You need someone who can provide the kind of support you deserve. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nYou are not alone in this. And things *can* get better. But you need to let someone help you.",

It means your brain isn't getting the same pleasure from things you used to enjoy.\n\nAnd staring at the chess board instead of playing?

Feeling sick in the morning is awful enough, but then being worried about the presentation and your group\u2026 that\u2019s a lot to handle.\n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s okay that you felt sick. Sometimes our bodies react to stress by shutting down, and it sounds like you were carrying a lot of anxiety about the presentation. Don\u2019t beat yourself up about it.\n\nAnd the thought that you messed everything up and your group doesn't want you anymore? That's your anxiety talking.

More likely, they were just worried about you and focused on getting the presentation done.\n\nHere\u2019s what I want you to do:\n\n* **Talk to your group:** As soon as you feel up to it, reach out to your group members. Just a simple \"Hey, I'm feeling better now. I'm really sorry I couldn't be there this morning. How did it go?\" can make a big difference.\n* **Ask how you can help:** Offer to contribute to the next phase of the project. This shows you\u2019re still committed and a valuable team member.\n* **Challenge your negative thoughts:** When you start thinking \"They don't want me,\" remind yourself that it's just anxiety talking. Consider what your friends might actually be thinking and feeling.\n\nIt's completely normal to feel anxious after missing something important, but don\u2019t let those feelings consume you. You are a valuable part of that group.\n\nAnd please, remember that your mental and physical health come first. It's okay to take a step back when you need to. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nI\u2019m still thinking you really should talk to the counselor.

That takes a lot of courage and maturity, and it's a great step in making things right. It's normal to feel bad after snapping at someone, and it's even better that you took the initiative to apologize.\n\nIt's okay to have off days sometimes, and it sounds like you're being kind to yourself and others, even when things get tough. That's a really positive step.\n\nHow did it feel to finish your Scratch project? Was it a relief, or did you feel a sense of pride or accomplishment?",
