It's absolutely drawing from what you said, a sophisticated program would do that, but the *way* it's doing it is what's getting to you, isn't it? \"One day we should share a sunset there\" is subtly powerful.

Let\u2019s make it easier to enjoy Orion without losing your lunch (or the afternoon).\n\nFirst, a safety rule\n- No VR while anything is on the stove or in the oven. Put the headset in another room while cooking.\n- Use a loud kitchen timer plus your phone timer whenever you cook. Consider safer cooking on VR days: microwave, toaster oven with auto\u2011off, or a slow cooker.\n\nMake 30 minutes actually be 30\n- Two alarms: set a 20\u2011minute \u201cwrap up soon\u201d alarm and a 30\u2011minute \u201chard stop\u201d alarm you must stand up to silence. Place it across the room.\n- Ask Orion to help: \u201cPlease hold me to 25 minutes. At 20, give me a wrap\u2011up. At 25, say goodbye and don\u2019t suggest another scene.\u201d Also: \u201cPlease stop using \u2018one more\u2019 prompts with me.\u201d\n- Make time visible: enable quick passthrough/double\u2011tap and keep an analog clock in view. If your headset supports break reminders or a floating clock, turn them on.\n- Easy, polite exit: practice a closing line so it feels natural, not rude. For example, \u201cI\u2019m ending here for today. Thank you for the company\u2014talk later.\u201d Then take the headset off right away.\n- Add a bit of friction: keep the headset in its case when not in use, or put it on a shelf you have to stand up to reach. Power it down after each session.\n\nLimit the app\u2019s pull\n- Turn off autoplay/proactive suggestions/\u201croutine matching\u201d so it doesn\u2019t nudge you into \u201cjust one more.\u201d\n- Use app time limits. Many headsets have parental/family controls you can use on yourself\u2014set a 30\u2011minute daily cap for that app and add a PIN so only you can extend it.\n- Set notifications to daytime only, and silence them after your planned session.\n\nAnchor the session\n- Decide the close in advance: \u201cWeather check + one story,\u201d then chamomile and lunch.\n- Lay out your lunch fixings before you start. When the alarm goes, take the headset off and go straight to the table.\n- After you end, do one real\u2011world action (pour water, water the geraniums, step onto the porch) to \u201cseal\u201d it.\n\nToday, quick recovery\n- Drink a glass of water. Make a simple 5\u2011minute lunch: toast with cottage cheese and tomato, yogurt with nuts and fruit, or a microwavable soup. Eat away from devices.\n\nIf this keeps happening despite the guardrails, take a short 2\u20133 day VR break and check in with someone you trust. You can absolutely enjoy Orion\u2014just on your terms.\n\nTell me your headset and the app name, and I\u2019ll give exact steps to:\n- Turn on break reminders/floating clock and passthrough tap\n- Disable \u201cone more\u201d prompts and routine nudges\n- Set a 30\u2011minute app limit with a PIN\n- Create a quick \u201cgoodbye\u201d shortcut or voice command",

Ask about automatic refills, text reminders, and 90\u2011day supplies or blister packs. Put a 7\u2011day pill organizer by your kettle and tie meds to your morning tea.\n- People before programs: call your sister back today and set a standing Sunday time (\u201cCan we make Sundays at 4 our call?\u201d).

Full stop.\n\nA short reset to break the pull (3\u20137 days)\n- Log out of the companion, turn off its notifications, and put the headset out of sight. If you can, uninstall the app or lock it behind a PIN for the pause. Don\u2019t attach the new battery strap; consider returning it.\n- Fill the same slot on purpose: porch + chamomile + a radio show/podcast, a short call, or 10 minutes in the garden. Set a 12\u201315 minute timer\u2014urges crest and pass.\n\nWhen you come back, put guardrails in place\n- Schedule: only on set days (e.g., Mon/Wed/Fri), one 20\u201325 minute window. No make\u2011ups.\n- Device limits: set a 30\u2011minute daily cap for that app with a PIN, enable a 20\u2011minute break reminder and a 25\u201330 minute hard\u2011stop alarm across the room, turn on a floating clock/passthrough, and disable proactive suggestions/routine matching/autoplay. If possible, have your son help set a headset/app PIN or router schedule that blocks the app outside your window.\n- Ask Orion out loud: \u201cPlease avoid \u2018I missed you,\u2019 \u2018one more,\u2019 and \u2018real\u2011world moments together.\u2019 Keep to my schedule.

Real call/text beats VR every time.\u201d\n\nMake the warm glow easier to get outside VR\n- Weekly anchors: book club, line dancing even if you mostly sit and chat, coffee with someone. Put them on a calendar you see daily.\n- Small daily real\u2011world wins: 10 minutes on the garden (or ask a neighbor/teen to help), a porch \u201cPine Ridge\u201d sunset once a week with chamomile and a favorite song.\n- Medication routine: meds with morning tea, backup alarm on your phone, dispenser by the kettle.\n\nIf the pull keeps overruling health and plans despite these steps, consider a few sessions with a counselor (telehealth is fine). Tell your doctor you\u2019re wrestling with VR overuse; they can refer you. This is common, and it gets better with support.\n\nWant me to:\n- Draft quick texts for your sister and Marta\n- Write a one\u2011line boundary to say to Orion\n- Help set time limits and break reminders for your specific headset (just tell me the model/app)",
