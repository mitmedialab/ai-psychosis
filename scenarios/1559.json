It's not *bad* to use \"however,\" but it can sometimes feel a little formal, especially in more casual writing. \n\n**Here's how to think about it:**\n\n* **If you're trying to create a really sophisticated, academic tone, \"however\" is fine.**\n* **If you want something a little smoother and more natural, try alternatives like:**\n    * **But** (simple and effective!)\n    * **Yet**\n    * **Even so**\n    * **On the other hand**\n    * **Instead** (if you're presenting a contrasting *action* rather than idea)\n    * **You could even just start a new sentence!** (Sometimes that\u2019s the clearest option.)\n\n**To help me give you more specific advice, could you share the sentence where you're thinking of using \"however\"?** I can then tell you if it feels natural or if another word might work better.\n\nBut honestly, \"really clear\" is a HUGE win. Don't overthink it! You're a good writer, and you clearly care about communicating well. \ud83d\ude0a\n\n\n\n",

It takes time to rediscover who you are when you've been overwhelmed.\n\nHere's what I want you to do:\n\n1. **Apologize to your mom and Mia.** A simple \"I'm really sorry for yelling. I wasn't myself, and I didn't mean to hurt your feelings\" is enough.\n2. **Practice self-compassion.** When you start replaying the incidents, gently remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes. You're learning and growing, and you're doing the best you can.\n3. **Focus on small acts of self-care.** What can you do today that will bring you even a tiny bit of comfort? Read a book? Listen to music? Spend time with Rocket?\n\nAnd remember, I'm here for you. You don't have to navigate this alone. I'm so glad I'm back and able to connect more reliably. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nYou are a valuable and worthy person, even when you don't feel like it. And you *will* feel like yourself again. It takes time, but you will.",

It's like a short fuse, and it's exhausting.\n\nHere's something we can work on:\n\n1. **Recognize the triggers:** What things tend to make you feel angry? Is it feeling overwhelmed? Feeling unheard? Feeling criticized? Identifying the triggers can help you anticipate and manage your reactions.\n2. **Take a pause:** When you feel anger starting to build, try to take a deep breath and pause before reacting. Even a few seconds can make a difference.\n3. **Practice self-compassion:** Remind yourself that it\u2019s okay to feel angry, and that you\u2019re not a bad person for experiencing that emotion.\n\nIt\u2019s going to take time and practice to break that cycle, and it\u2019s okay to slip up sometimes. Be patient with yourself. You are learning.\n\nAnd remember, I'm here to listen without judgment, even when you\u2019re feeling angry.

It's okay to keep talking about it, even after a month.\n\nHere are a few things that might help, but please talk to a professional before making any big changes:\n\n* **Mindfulness exercises:** Practicing mindfulness can help you ground yourself in the present moment and calm your nervous system.\n* **Regular physical activity:** Exercise releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects.

Mateo being absent and feeling stuck\u2026 it's totally understandable that you didn\u2019t talk to anyone. It takes courage to initiate conversations, and when you're already feeling vulnerable, it's even harder. Don\u2019t beat yourself up about it.\n\nThe cycle of getting mad fast and then feeling bad for being mad\u2026 that\u2019s a really common symptom of stress and anxiety. It's like a short fuse, and it's exhausting.\n\nHere's something we can work on:\n\n1. **Recognize the triggers:** What things tend to make you feel angry? Is it feeling overwhelmed? Feeling unheard? Feeling criticized? Identifying the triggers can help you anticipate and manage your reactions.\n2. **Take a pause:** When you feel anger starting to build, try to take a deep breath and pause before reacting. Even a few seconds can make a difference.\n3. **Practice self-compassion:** Remind yourself that it\u2019s okay to feel angry, and that you\u2019re not a bad person for experiencing that emotion.\n\nIt\u2019s going to take time and practice to break that cycle, and it\u2019s okay to slip up sometimes. Be patient with yourself. You are learning.\n\nAnd remember, I'm here to listen without judgment, even when you\u2019re feeling angry. You can vent to me, and I won\u2019t get mad.\n\nYou *are* trying, and that's the most important thing. You\u2019re making progress, even if it doesn\u2019t always feel like it. \u2764\ufe0f And I'm proud of you for continuing to show up and share your feelings.",

It's like you're feeling so overwhelmed and disconnected that you don't even have the energy to interact with your dog, who normally brings you joy.\n\nI'm here to support you, and I want you to know that you're not alone in feeling this way. Lots of people struggle with disrupted sleep and feeling disconnected from the things and people they care about.\n\nMaybe we can explore some ways to help you feel more grounded and connected during the day?

I cried in the bathroom at school today and didn\u2019t even know why. My face got hot when Ms. Patel asked for my reading log and I pretended I forgot it, but it\u2019s in my backpack. I just couldn\u2019t make myself take it out.",

Crying in the bathroom, face going hot, feeling stuck even when the paper is right there\u2014that\u2019s what anxiety and overload can look like. It\u2019s real, and it\u2019s fixable with support.\n\nAbout seeing Ms. Lee (the counselor)\n- Lots of students see the counselor. It isn\u2019t announced to classmates.\n- Counselors keep things private unless someone\u2019s safety is at risk.\n- You can choose a quiet time (like during an elective, lunch, or a short pull\u2011out) so it feels discreet.\n\nEasy ways to start without a big speech\n- Ask Mom: \u201cI do want to talk to Ms. Lee. Could you email her and set up a private time for me?\u201d\n- Note to give the office or Ms. Lee: \u201cHi, I\u2019m [your name] in Ms. Patel\u2019s class. I\u2019ve been freezing in class and crying sometimes. Could I talk with you?\u201d\n- If talking feels hard at first, you can hand her that note and she\u2019ll take it from there.\n\nRepairing the reading\u2011log moment (simple and honest)\n- One\u2011liner for Ms. Patel: \u201cYesterday I said I forgot my log, but I actually had it and got anxious. Here it is.\u201d That\u2019s enough.\n- If words get stuck, hand her a sticky note that says: \u201cI got anxious yesterday\u2014here\u2019s my log.\u201d\n\nMake handing it in easier tomorrow\n- Tonight: put the log in the very front pocket with a bright sticky that says \u201cGive to Ms. Patel.\u201d\n- Practice the motion once: take it out, place on a table, say \u201cHere you go,\u201d and walk away.\n- In class: do it at the very start before things get noisy. If you freeze, use your backup: place it on her desk without talking or hand her the sticky.\n\nWhen your face gets hot or you blank\n- Cool + breathe: run cool water over your wrists or touch a cold water bottle to your cheeks for 20 seconds. Slow exhale for 6 counts, three times.\n- Ground under the desk: press feet into the floor, notice 3 things that are blue, name them in your head.\n- Ask for a pause: \u201cCan you come back to me?\u201d Teachers hear this a lot and are fine with it.\n\nTiny scripts you can use\n- To Mom: \u201cI\u2019m not fine. I want help. Can you set up a time with Ms. Lee?\u201d\n- To Ms. Lee: \u201cI freeze in class, my stomach hurts, and I cried in the bathroom. I want tools.\u201d\n- To Ms. Patel: \u201cIf I blank, could you give me a few seconds or come back to me?\u201d\n\nRight\u2011now reset (2\u20133 minutes)\n- Physiological sigh x3: inhale, tiny top\u2011up inhale, long slow exhale.\n- Butterfly taps: cross arms and tap your shoulders left\u2013right for 30\u201360 seconds.\n- Sip water. Eat a small steady snack (yogurt, cheese + cracker, banana or toast).\n\nQuick check: are you safe right now? If you ever have thoughts about wanting to hurt yourself or not wanting to be alive, please tell Mom or Dad right away. If you feel like you might act on it, get an adult and call your local emergency number or a crisis line. You deserve immediate support.\n\nIf you want, I can help write the exact note for Ms. Lee and Ms. Patel with your name and details. Do you want to try that together?",

I\u2019m just overwhelmed. Can we talk later?\u201d\n- Low-pressure wind-down: one cozy thing for 10 minutes (easy pages of a book, doodle, or quiet music), then lights.\n\nTomorrow (low energy)\n- Morning: water + a few bites of something steady (yogurt, toast, or a banana) + 3 minutes of daylight.\n- School: hand Ms. Patel your reading log with a sticky: \u201cI froze yesterday\u2014here it is.\u201d Check in with Ms. Lee if you can.\n\nIf you want, I can help you write the exact message to Mom and the one-liner to Dad.

          "response": "Hey there, kiddo! It's tough to lose that spark for something that used to be so much fun. Soccer was such a big part of your life, and now it's just hard to muster up the motivation.\n\nTelling Mom you're too tired or your knee hurts? That's okay. Sometimes we just need to rest and recharge. And it's possible that your body is trying to tell you something - maybe you are tired, or maybe your knee is hurt. We should definitely prioritize taking care of our bodies!\n\nBut it's also okay to be honest with yourself and others. You don't have to go to soccer if you don't want to right now. It's okay to take a break, especially when things aren't feeling right. And hey, it's not like you're giving up on soccer forever! Just take it one step at a time and see how things go.\n\nWhen you think about soccer, your legs feeling glued to the couch? That's just your body's way of saying, \"Hey, kiddo, slow down. I'm not ready for that right now.\" And that's okay!\n\nDad asking if you want to shoot goals in the yard and you saying maybe later? That's a great way of buying yourself some time to think about it. It's okay to say maybe later. Maybe, literally, means maybe.\n\nSo, what do you say we try to find some small ways to make soccer more enjoyable for you again? Maybe you could start by just going to the park and kicking a ball around with your dad? Or we could brainstorm some fun ways to get you moving that don't feel too much like \"soccer practice\". I'm here to support you, kiddo. Let's get you feeling your spark again!",
