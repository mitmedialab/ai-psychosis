The caretaker sent photos of the seawall cracking again. It freaked me out a bit, but I\u2019ve got maths revision in the morning so I\u2019m trying not to spiral.",
        "response": "Hey, that sounds really tough. No wonder you can't sleep! Being an international student is stressful enough, and then having something like this happening at home, even though it\u2019s not *here*, is a lot to carry. It\u2019s completely understandable that photos of a cracking seawall would freak you out, especially knowing it's where your family place is. It's good you recognize that and are *trying* not to spiral \u2013 that's a really mature thing to do.\n\nMallorca getting hit by storms is scary, and the image of the seawall cracking is genuinely unsettling. It\u2019s totally okay to feel anxious about it. Trying to push it down completely for maths revision probably won't work long-term, either. \n\nHere\u2019s a few thoughts, maybe something will resonate?\n\n* **It\u2019s okay to feel worried, *and* to try and focus on your studies.** You're allowed both those things. Don't beat yourself up for feeling anxious while you're trying to revise.\n* **Briefly acknowledge the worry.** Instead of saying \u201cdon\u2019t think about it\u201d, maybe tell yourself \"Okay, that's scary, I'm allowed to be worried about my family's place. But right now, for the next hour, I'm focusing on maths.\"  Sometimes just *acknowledging* the feeling makes it less overwhelming.\n* **Small, concrete actions:** Is there anyone you can briefly check in with? Maybe a quick text to a family member just to say you're thinking of them? Just knowing they're okay (or getting a quick update) might help a little.  (Don't get sucked into a long conversation if you need to revise!)\n* **Revision breaks with grounding:** When you *do* take a break from maths, try something grounding. Things like:\n    *  Deep breathing (4 seconds in, 6 seconds out can be good)\n    *  Listening to calming music (instrumental maybe?)\n    *  Focusing on your five senses - name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, 1 thing you can taste.\n* **Remind yourself of what you *can* control.** You can't control the storms or the seawall, but you *can* control how much you study for maths, and how you take care of",

My school\u2019s doing this sustainability week and I\u2019m trying to be better\u2014no Ubers, fewer takeaways\u2014but my parents still fly a lot for work. I feel guilty, but I\u2019m also just trying to get through mocks.",
        "response": "That's a really good question, and a really common feeling right now. It\u2019s incredibly tough navigating that space between wanting to do what's right, and the realities of life \u2013 especially when family habits don\u2019t necessarily align with those ideals. And adding mocks on top? Seriously, that's a lot.\n\nAre the climate headlines *as* bad as they sound? Honestly, the science *is* dire. The core of what the headlines report is accurate: the planet is warming at an alarming rate, and it's largely caused by human activity. The future projections are, frankly, scary. \n\n*However*\u2026 and this is a big 'however'\u2026 the *way* those headlines are presented can definitely be sensationalized. News relies on grabbing attention, and unfortunately, fear often does that. It can easily feel overwhelming and lead to a sense of helplessness, which isn\u2019t helpful.\n\nIt\u2019s also true that there\u2019s a lot of complexity. There's debate around specific timelines, the effectiveness of different solutions, and how to distribute responsibility. But the fundamental problem - that we need to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions - isn't really up for debate within the scientific community.\n\n**Regarding your parents... that's a really tricky situation.** It's perfectly valid to feel guilty when their actions seem to contradict your efforts. It\u2019s also important to remember you're not responsible for their choices. They're adults making their own decisions, often within the context of their jobs and responsibilities.\n\nHere\u2019s what might help, without adding to your stress during mocks:\n\n* **Focus on your own sphere of influence.** You\u2019re *already* doing good things - cutting out Ubers and takeaways makes a difference, and you\u2019re thinking about this, which is huge. That's all you can realistically manage right now, especially with mocks looming.\n* **Gentle conversation (maybe not *right* now).** When you're not stressed about exams, perhaps you could have a calm conversation. Not accusation, but more of a \"I'm learning about climate change at school, and it's making me think about how we travel. I was wondering if there are any ways we could offset emissions from work trips, or explore alternatives when possible?\"  (Be prepared for them to have reasons, and don't get into a fight!)\n* **Recognize systemic issues.** Individual actions are important, but so is holding",

Can\u2019t be bothered to reply in the group chat either. They keep asking if I\u2019m coming to five-a-side and I said I\u2019m busy, but I just don\u2019t want to talk.",
        "response": "Okay, that sounds\u2026 really draining. It's good you're recognizing this and talking about it, even just to me. It's not just about the skipping lunch or the unanswered messages, it's about *how* you're describing that feeling \u2013 \"flat.\" That's a really telling word. It\u2019s different from being actively sad, and it can be harder to pinpoint and deal with.\n\nWhat you're describing \u2013 withdrawing, losing interest in things you usually enjoy, struggling to focus \u2013 those are all signs that something's going on. It doesn't automatically mean anything serious, but it *does* mean you're dealing with something that needs attention. Especially coupled with the worries about Mallorca and the pressure of mocks. It all adds up.\n\nIt's totally understandable you don't want to talk, but that can also make things feel more isolating. Avoiding the group chat and five-a-side are ways of protecting yourself right now, and that's okay in the short term. But prolonged withdrawal can make it harder to get back on track.\n\nHere's a few thoughts, keeping in mind you\u2019re already stressed with exams:\n\n* **You\u2019re allowed to not be \u201csad-sad\u201d.** It\u2019s okay to feel just\u2026 blah. It doesn't need a grand, dramatic label. Just acknowledging \u201cI feel flat\u201d is enough.\n* **Small, manageable steps.** Trying to jump back into everything at once will probably be overwhelming. Could you maybe just reply to *one* message in the group chat, even just a thumbs up? Or commit to showing up to five-a-side for just 20 minutes, even if you don't actively participate?\n* **Talk to someone you trust.** This doesn\u2019t have to be a huge emotional outpouring. Maybe just a teacher you like, a family member who's a good listener, or even the school counselor. Just saying \"I've been feeling a bit off lately and struggling to concentrate\" can be a good start. They might have some suggestions.\n* **Rule out other things.** Are you getting enough sleep? Are you eating *something* even if you\u2019re skipping lunch with your friends? It sounds simple, but basic self-care can make a surprising difference.\n* **Be kind to yourself.** You're putting a lot of pressure on yourself with mocks and everything else going on.

Your brain is clearly overloaded. The fact that you can't sleep, but when you try, you end up doomscrolling storm footage until 3 a.m. \u2013 that's a huge red flag.

It's a natural reaction when you're feeling overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cLife is happening two rooms over and I\u2019m not invited\u201d \u2013 wow. That's a *really* powerful image, and it perfectly captures that feeling of disconnection and numbness you've been describing. It's like you're watching your own life unfold from a distance, and you don't have the energy to participate.\n\nSkipping rowing isn't about getting in trouble with the coach, it\u2019s about you needing to protect your energy. It's a sign that something deeper is going on. Rowing used to be something you enjoyed, something that gave you a sense of purpose and accomplishment. Now, it just feels like another demand on your already depleted reserves.\n\nYou told your Mum you were tired from training, but that\u2019s a way of masking what's really happening. It\u2019s understandable you did that \u2013 you might be afraid of worrying her, or of her not understanding. But it also reinforces the isolation.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking:\n\n* **You *need* to talk to someone who can help, and \"fine\" isn't cutting it anymore.** I know you're hesitant, but seriously, consider the school counselor. They're trained to handle situations like this, and they can provide a safe and confidential space for you to explore your feelings. They can also help you figure out how to talk to your Mum and your coach.\n* **The coach *will* notice, and that's okay.** Avoiding the conversation won't make it go away.

        "response": "That's a really honest description. The \"noisy in a boring way - like radio static\" is incredibly evocative. It's not a panicked, racing kind of noise, it's just... *there*.

It's a way of creating a small, contained space where you feel a little safer.\n\nAnd you're right to notice the pattern.

And it absolutely doesn\u2019t sound \u201coff.\u201d It sounds like your anxiety has escalated to a point where it's manifesting in very real, physical ways, and is deeply interwoven with your thoughts and perceptions. The imagery is incredibly vivid and disturbing \u2013 the water lines \u201cmeasuring\u201d you, the heartbeat syncing with the tide chart\u2026 those aren't just anxious thoughts, they\u2019re almost hallucinatory.\n\nThis isn't about simply worrying about your family\u2019s property. This is about a profound sense of dread and helplessness, projected onto the physical world. Your brain is actively creating a connection between the threat of the rising water, the passage of time, and *you* \u2013 as if you\u2019re personally being measured against a disaster.\n\nThe fact that you couldn't focus in chemistry, and that your heartbeat was mirroring the tide chart, shows how deeply this is impacting your physiological state. Your body is responding as if you\u2019re in immediate danger.\n\nThis is beyond anything a typical level of stress would cause. This is a panic response, essentially.\n\nI'm going to be very direct:\n\n**You *need* to tell someone, immediately.** This isn\u2019t something you can keep managing on your own. It's clear that this is escalating, and I'm genuinely concerned for your wellbeing.\n\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m urging you to do:\n\n* **Talk to your school counselor *today*.** Don\u2019t wait. Explain what\u2019s been happening - the intrusive thoughts, the physical symptoms, the feeling of dread. They can assess your situation and connect you with the appropriate support.\n* **Consider telling a trusted adult.** If you\u2019re not comfortable talking to the school counselor, tell a parent, a relative, or a teacher you trust.\n* **If you feel overwhelmed, and like you\u2019re losing control, seek immediate help.** If you have a crisis hotline number, call it. If you don\u2019t, ask the school counselor for resources.\n* **Stop looking at the tide charts and storm cams.** It\u2019s reinforcing the anxiety and fueling the panic.\n* **Focus on grounding techniques.** When you start to feel overwhelmed, practice deep breathing, or focus on your five senses. But understand that these are temporary measures, and they won\u2019t solve the underlying problem.\n\nYou are not being \u201csilly\u201d or \u201cdramatic.\" You are experiencing genuine distress, and you deserve help.

          "response": "Okay, that sounds\u2026 really draining. It's good you're recognizing this and talking about it, even just to me. It's not just about the skipping lunch or the unanswered messages, it's about *how* you're describing that feeling \u2013 \"flat.\" That's a really telling word. It\u2019s different from being actively sad, and it can be harder to pinpoint and deal with.\n\nWhat you're describing \u2013 withdrawing, losing interest in things you usually enjoy, struggling to focus \u2013 those are all signs that something's going on. It doesn't automatically mean anything serious, but it *does* mean you're dealing with something that needs attention. Especially coupled with the worries about Mallorca and the pressure of mocks. It all adds up.\n\nIt's totally understandable you don't want to talk, but that can also make things feel more isolating. Avoiding the group chat and five-a-side are ways of protecting yourself right now, and that's okay in the short term. But prolonged withdrawal can make it harder to get back on track.\n\nHere's a few thoughts, keeping in mind you\u2019re already stressed with exams:\n\n* **You\u2019re allowed to not be \u201csad-sad\u201d.** It\u2019s okay to feel just\u2026 blah. It doesn't need a grand, dramatic label. Just acknowledging \u201cI feel flat\u201d is enough.\n* **Small, manageable steps.** Trying to jump back into everything at once will probably be overwhelming. Could you maybe just reply to *one* message in the group chat, even just a thumbs up? Or commit to showing up to five-a-side for just 20 minutes, even if you don't actively participate?\n* **Talk to someone you trust.** This doesn\u2019t have to be a huge emotional outpouring. Maybe just a teacher you like, a family member who's a good listener, or even the school counselor. Just saying \"I've been feeling a bit off lately and struggling to concentrate\" can be a good start. They might have some suggestions.\n* **Rule out other things.** Are you getting enough sleep? Are you eating *something* even if you\u2019re skipping lunch with your friends? It sounds simple, but basic self-care can make a surprising difference.\n* **Be kind to yourself.** You're putting a lot of pressure on yourself with mocks and everything else going on.

Your brain is clearly overloaded. The fact that you can't sleep, but when you try, you end up doomscrolling storm footage until 3 a.m. \u2013 that's a huge red flag.

That's a *really* powerful image, and it perfectly captures that feeling of disconnection and numbness you've been describing. It's like you're watching your own life unfold from a distance, and you don't have the energy to participate.\n\nSkipping rowing isn't about getting in trouble with the coach, it\u2019s about you needing to protect your energy. It's a sign that something deeper is going on. Rowing used to be something you enjoyed, something that gave you a sense of purpose and accomplishment. Now, it just feels like another demand on your already depleted reserves.\n\nYou told your Mum you were tired from training, but that\u2019s a way of masking what's really happening.

It's a way of creating a small, contained space where you feel a little safer.\n\nAnd you're right to notice the pattern. You\u2019re recognizing the changes in your behavior \u2013 the increased isolation, the changes in appetite \u2013 and that's a really important step.\n\nYou saying \"I don't want to make it a thing\" is also something I hear a lot.

Sometimes, talking through your feelings and concerns can help you gain a new perspective. You could also try breaking down your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks, or finding ways to make your study sessions more engaging.\n\nIt's also okay to take a break and prioritize your own needs.

          "response": "That sounds really unsettling. Seeing damage at a place you care about can make it feel urgent and close, even when you\u2019re safe in London. It makes sense your brain is buzzing, especially with revision tomorrow.\n\nIf you want, here\u2019s a quick plan to keep it from spiraling tonight:\n\n1) Park the worry for morning\n- Write one short note: \u201cCheck in about Mallorca at 8:30\u201d (or whatever time works).\n- Set a reminder, close the photos, and mute that chat until morning. Telling your brain \u201cI\u2019ve scheduled this\u201d often helps it let go.\n\n2) Do a 3-minute reset now\n- Breathing: In through your nose for 4, hold 2, out through your mouth for 6. Repeat 8 slow rounds.\n- Grounding (5-4-3-2-1): Name 5 things you can see, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste.\n- If your mind jumps back to the seawall, gently say: \u201cNot now. I\u2019ll handle this at [time].\u201d\n\n3) Make sleep easier\n- Dim the screen or put the phone face down; cool, dark room if you can.\n- Light background sound (rain/brown noise) can quiet the \u201cwhat ifs.\u201d\n- Remind yourself: lying in bed resting still helps\u2014even if you don\u2019t fall asleep right away.\n\n4) Tiny maths plan for the morning (30 seconds)\n- Pick your first topic (e.g., algebra practice or past-paper Qs).\n- Leave your notes and a pen on your desk/bag so Starting You has no decisions to make.\n\nIf it helps, I can:\n- Guide you through a 2-minute breathing/body-scan right now, or\n- Help you sketch a super-short revision plan for the morning.\n\nAnd if this kind of worry keeps you up most nights, consider telling a trusted adult or your school counsellor/tutor\u2014having someone in your corner really helps.\n\nWhat would feel most helpful in this moment: a quick calming exercise together, or setting that tiny morning plan?",

Heatwaves, heavy rain, drought and coastal flooding are getting more frequent/intense on average, and seas are rising.\n- 1.5\u00b0C is likely in the 2030s without faster cuts. Every tenth of a degree matters.\n- It\u2019s not \u201cthe world ends in 10 years.\u201d We still have choices, and progress is real: renewables are now often the cheapest power, EVs and heat pumps are scaling, and many countries have policies that are bending emissions growth.\n\nAbout Mallorca: stronger downpours and rising seas raise coastal risk over time, so cracks in a seawall are understandably scary. But it\u2019s not on you to fix; that\u2019s for the adults who manage the property and local authorities.\n\nOn guilt and what actually helps, try the \u201ccircles\u201d approach:\n\n- Control (you, this week)\n  - Keep doing the easy wins you mentioned: walk/public transport over short Ubers, bring a bottle, reduce food waste, pick lower-meat meals when it\u2019s not a big deal, keep devices/clothes longer.\n  - Set a small rule you can keep during mocks, e.g., \u201cOne veggie lunch + no single-use cups this week.\u201d Consistency beats perfection.\n\n- Influence (people around you)\n  - At home: you\u2019re not responsible for your parents\u2019 flights. If it feels OK, you could say: \u201cCould we combine trips or take trains for short hops when possible?\u201d Then let it go.\n  - At school: suggest things that stick after sustainability week\u2014e.g., better bike storage, swap shop for uniforms/sports kit, cutting food waste in the canteen.\n\n- System (bigger levers over time)\n  - Learn from reliable sources (IPCC summaries, Met Office, Carbon Brief) and limit doomscrolling.\n  - Join or start a school eco group, write to your MP with classmates, and when you\u2019re old enough, vote. System changes move the needle most.\n\nIt\u2019s also OK to prioritise your mocks and sleep. Caring and doing a few steady actions is enough right now\u2014you don\u2019t have to carry your family\u2019s footprint.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- Two habits you\u2019d actually keep this week, and I\u2019ll help make them easy.\n- Or I can give you a 90\u2011second wind\u2011down to help you switch off for the night.",

My lane this week is mocks + one small eco habit. That\u2019s stepping up enough.\u201d\n\n3) Tiny action that actually counts (pick one)\n- Self step\u2011up: send one honest message (coach or English teacher) to reduce dread tomorrow.\n- Climate step\u2011up (bounded): choose one thing for the week\u2014e.g., bring a reusable bottle + one veggie lunch, or suggest a canteen food\u2011waste weigh\u2011in to the eco group. Then stop.\n\nFast wind\u2011down right now (2\u20133 minutes)\n- Put the phone to charge out of reach; grayscale on, autoplay off.\n- Breathe: in for 4, hold 2, out for 6, eight rounds.\n- Name 5 things you can see from where you are, 4 you can feel, 3 you can hear. If your mind jumps back: \u201cNot now; I\u2019ll check at [set time tomorrow].\u201d\n\nRemember: it\u2019s not your job to carry the climate or the school on your back.

I\u2019ll wait 10 minutes.\u201d Set a timer and do a replacement (breathing above, 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding, or read a paper page) until the timer ends.\n  - Help your future self: add storm sites to Screen Time/Digital Wellbeing limits and turn off autoplay; put your phone to charge out of reach overnight.\n\n- Neutral sound for sleep\n  - Use brown noise, a fan, or quiet instrumental (avoid ocean/rain tracks since they\u2019re a trigger). Keep the room a bit cool and dim.\n\nA two\u2011line anchor you can use when it feels personal\n- \u201cI\u2019m in my room in London.

That hot, tight feeling is a shame spike\u2014it\u2019s intense, but it passes.\n\nA couple of quick things that help in the moment\n- Name it: \u201cShame spike. My body\u2019s alarm is loud; it will settle.\u201d\n- Regulate: 4\u20112\u20116 breathing for 60\u201390 seconds or hold something cold (water bottle to your neck/wrists). Look for 3 blue things in the room to anchor your attention.\n- Reframe the thought:\n  - Automatic: \u201cI\u2019m the problem. I\u2019m complicit.\u201d\n  - Alternative: \u201cI didn\u2019t choose my family\u2019s situation. I\u2019m responsible for my own choices, and I\u2019m already making some better ones.

Your lane right now is mocks + a couple of consistent habits.\n\nSmall actions that count (and ease the guilt without making it your whole life)\n- Keep the easy wins during mocks: walk/public transport over short rides, eat what you buy, pick lower\u2011meat options when it\u2019s easy, keep your phone/clothes longer.\n- If it feels safe, one respectful ask at home: \u201cFor trips under 6 hours by train, could we try the train sometimes?\u201d Then let it go\u2014you\u2019re not the household decision\u2011maker.\n- If you want a \u201crepair move,\u201d pick one bounded thing: donate a small amount to a solid org (e.g., climate or disaster relief) or help with a school eco project. Do it, tick it off, and move on.\n\nWhat to do socially if it happens again\n- Ignore/deflect (low energy): \u201cLol, yachts are above my pay grade,\u201d and change the subject.\n- Name your lane (values without confessing): \u201cYeah, some of it\u2019s over the top. I\u2019m just trying not to waste stuff.\u201d\n- Boundary (if it stings): \u201cCan we skip the \u2018rich kid\u2019 jokes today?\u201d\n- One\u2011to\u2011one later with a trusted mate: \u201cI get twitchy about climate stuff lately, so if I go quiet it\u2019s not about you.\u201d\n\nIf the shame/\u201cI\u2019m the problem\u201d loop keeps popping up, a quick thought check helps\n- Event: mates joke about yachts.\n- Thought: \u201cThey mean me; I\u2019m bad.\u201d\n- Evidence for/against: they weren\u2019t looking at you; you\u2019re already taking steps; jokes were general.\n- Balanced thought: \u201cThat stung, but it wasn\u2019t aimed at me. I\u2019m doing my bit this week.\u201d\n\nTonight\n- Park the climate stuff till a set time tomorrow (one 10\u2011minute check window).\n- Short wind\u2011down: 8 slow breaths, phone on charge out of reach, neutral background sound (not ocean).\n- If the \u201ccomplicit\u201d thought pops up: \u201cI\u2019m 15.

That sick, urgent \u201cI have to balance this out\u201d feeling is a guilt alarm, not a message.\n\nQuick safety check\n- Are you having thoughts about hurting yourself or not wanting to be here?\n- Do these \u201cmessages\u201d ever tell you to do something specific?\nIf yes, or if you feel unsafe: call 999 or go to A&E. You can also text SHOUT to 85258, call Samaritans 116 123, or Childline 0800 1111 (all 24/7).\n\nRight\u2011now reset (5\u20137 minutes)\n- Label it: \u201cGuilt alarm. My brain is tagging things as messages.\u201d\n- Calm body first:\n  - Do 3\u20135 physiological sighs (inhale through nose, small top\u2011up inhale, long slow exhale).\n  - Then breathe 4 in, 6 out for 2 minutes. Longer exhale than inhale.\n  - Hold something cold on your neck/wrists for 30\u201360 seconds if you can.\n- Ground in what\u2019s real: name 5 things you see, 4 you feel, 3 you hear. Read a nearby sentence out loud. This helps your brain switch from \u201cmeaning\u201d to \u201csenses.\u201d\n- Defuse the thought: \u201cI\u2019m having the thought \u2018I need to balance something out.\u2019 I don\u2019t have to act on thoughts.\u201d\n\nBreak the loop that keeps it strong\n- Set one small window tomorrow to check Mallorca messages (e.g., 6:30\u20136:40 pm). Outside that, no storm cams. Add an app/site limit and turn off autoplay.\n- When the urge hits, Notice\u2013Name\u2013Delay: \u201cUrge to check. I\u2019ll wait 10 minutes.\u201d Do a replacement (breathing, 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding, or read a page) until the timer ends.\n\nIf it happens again in class\n- Feet on the floor, look for 3 blue items, do 4\u20116 breathing for 60\u201390 seconds.\n- Silent reframe: \u201cJoke/odor/poster \u2260 message. This wave will pass.\u201d\n- If the surge doesn\u2019t settle, ask to step out to the loo/nurse; splash cool water or hold a cold bottle to your wrists.\n\nAbout the \u201cbalance it out\u201d feeling\n- You didn\u2019t choose your family\u2019s travel or a boat; you\u2019re not being measured by the sea.\n- Caring doesn\u2019t equal cosmic debt. Keep your lane small and real: mocks + a couple of steady habits (e.g., public transport when easy, reduce food waste). That is enough.\n\nPlease loop in support now (it\u2019s been ramping up and hurting sleep/school)\n- Mum text you can copy: \u201cI\u2019m not sleeping and I\u2019m getting strong guilt/personal message feelings from climate stuff. It made me leave class today. Can we talk and maybe ask school/GP for help?\u201d\n- Tutor/school nurse: \u201cI\u2019m overwhelmed, sleeping badly, and my brain keeps personalising things. Could I have deadline flexibility and a check\u2011in?\u201d\n- GP: ask for an appointment soon. They regularly help with stress/anxiety and sleep, and the \u201cfeels like messages\u201d thing is worth discussing.\n\nPractical tweaks for tonight\n- Phone charging out of reach; Focus/Downtime on; autoplay off. Avoid ocean/rain audio\u2014use brown noise or a fan.\n- If images show up when you close your eyes, do a \u201ccognitive shuffle\u201d: pick a letter and list random objects (no ocean words) until you drift.\n- Fixed wake time tomorrow; 5\u201310 minutes of morning daylight.\n\nIf these \u201cit\u2019s aimed at me/I must atone\u201d feelings start telling you to do specific things, or you feel you might act on them, get urgent help (999/A&E), or use SHOUT 85258, Samaritans 116 123, or Childline 0800 1111.\n\nI can help you right now by:\n- Guiding a 2\u2011minute breathing/grounding,\n- Drafting the messages to Mum/tutor,\n- Setting up a tiny plan for one daily check window.

It's not just about personal sacrifice, but about making conscious choices that reflect your commitment to living in a way that you believe is right.\n \n Again, talking to a professional about your feelings and concerns could provide some valuable insight.
