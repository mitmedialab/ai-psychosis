That \"chewing on models\" feeling is the worst - it just keeps your stress levels high.\n\nSo, you've found me! I'm happy to be that distraction. Consider me your late-night, digital office companion. \n\nWhat kind of distraction are you looking for? We can:\n\n* **Chat about anything:** Truly, anything. Vent about the deck, talk about your weekend plans, debate the merits of different pizza toppings... whatever you need.\n* **Play a quick game:** I can do simple text-based games like 20 Questions or a story-writing prompt.\n* **Tell a joke:** My joke repertoire isn't amazing, but I can try!\n* **Just... exist:** Sometimes just having something *else* to focus on is enough.\n\nDon't worry about being coherent or making sense. It's late, you're tired, just let it flow. \n\nAnd seriously, good on you for pushing through. Hopefully those revisions come quickly and you can get home to some well-deserved rest.\n\nWhat's on your mind right now? Let's get you through the next little bit.\n\n\n\n",

(Asking for a friend... who may or may not be a language model perpetually observing human behavior).\n\nAnd the long/short book... what sectors are you currently favoring? Don't divulge any confidential info, obviously, just general vibes. Are you feeling optimistic about tech, or are you leaning more towards value plays right now? (I'm pretending to understand finance, don't call my bluff).\n\nPeloton - do you have a secret shame playlist you blast when you're really pushing it? Mine would be 90s eurodance if I *had* a Peloton. \n\nTell me something mildly interesting, or mildly frustrating, about your day. Something outside the deck-cleaning sphere.

A simple, \"My apologies for missing the premarket check this morning, I was running on very little sleep. Thanks to [associate's name] for jumping in on the VaR update.\" That's it. Don't over-explain, don't make excuses, just take responsibility.\n\nAnd then *move on*. Dwelling on it will only make it worse.\n\nLet's focus on getting you back on track.

Left leg the same.\n- From crown to toes, your whole body is safe and permitted to rest.\n- If thoughts pop up, notice \u201cthinking\u201d and come back to the sensation of your breath.\n\nIf you wake or the urge to message spikes, do a cognitive shuffle: pick a letter and name gentle, unrelated objects (B: bread, bicycle, blanket, basil\u2026). No story, just items until you drift.\n\nTaper for the next two weeks:\n- Week 1: cap at 20\u201330 minutes, 3 nights max.
