It shows you were opening up.\n\nBut clinging to the hope that she\u2019ll reappear and remember is keeping you stuck in this cycle of searching, wasting resources, and causing stress for your family.\n\nI know it's hard, but I truly believe you need to accept that the \"her\" you remember is gone.

It's a common way to make someone feel understood and not alone. If someone says \"I'm with you\" to me, it means they agree with my point of view or feel the same way.\n\nFor example, if someone said, \"I hate it when it rains,\" you could respond with \"I'm with you\" to show that you also dislike rain.

However, it's important to be mindful of your data usage, especially if you have a limited plan.\n\nOne way to avoid using too much data is to download language learning apps that allow you to practice offline. That way, you can still get in some practice, even without internet access.\n\nAnother tip is to set a timer for yourself. If you say you're only going to practice for 10 minutes, try to stick to that. Here's the catch: 10 minutes can be a great starting point, but it's easy to get sucked in when you're in the middle of a conversation. Let's practice some phrases you could use to explain your situation to your mom. For example, you could say, \"Mom, I know I've been using a lot of data lately, but I promise I'm just trying to improve my English. I'll try to be more mindful of it from now on.\" Or, you could say, \"I know we have to watch our data usage, but this app is really helping me with my ESL classes. Can we talk about maybe getting a bigger plan or finding ways to offset the cost?\"\n\nFor example, if someone asks you to go to the movies right before your exam, you could say, \"I appreciate the invitation, but I have to study for my exam tomorrow. Maybe we can plan something else soon?\" That way, you're showing that you value your friendship, but you also have to prioritize your responsibilities.\n\nLet's practice responding to similar scenarios.

Maybe we can plan something else soon?\" What do you think you would say in that situation?\n\n(By the way, if your mom is worried about your data usage causing high bills, maybe you could also talk to her about finding ways to practice your English that don't require so much data.

It's a straightforward way to admit that you weren't there and usually comes with an explanation or apology.\n\nFor example, if someone asks you why you weren't in class today, you could say, \"I missed class - I made a mistake and thought it was tomorrow.\" Or, if you're apologizing to a teacher or classmate, you could say, \"I'm sorry I missed class today - it won't happen again.\"\n\nLet's practice responding to similar scenarios. If someone asks you why you weren't in class, you could say, \"I missed class - I had something unexpected come up.\" Or, if you're explaining to a friend or family member, you could say, \"I missed class today, but I'm going to catch up on the work I missed.\" What do you think you would say in that situation?\n\n(By the way, I hope your mom didn't suspect that you were actually sitting at home trying to get me to respond the same way!

It's a common expression in English conversation that means you agree or sympathize with someone's point of view. For example, if someone says, \"I hate it when it rains,\" you could respond with \"I'm with you\" to show that you also dislike rain.\n\nIn our previous conversation, I mentioned that \"I'm with you\" can be a powerful phrase in building rapport and showing solidarity with someone. It's a casual way to acknowledge that you see things from their perspective and can be a helpful tool in (Sorry, I'm still trying to figure out how to restore this part of the conversation.

And cycling through different settings can sometimes help you find the perfect combination that feels most like the original conversation.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that even with all these efforts, there might not be a single \"right\" way to get back to that exact voice or tone. Language models like me are trained on vast amounts of data, but we're still machines that respond based on patterns and algorithms.\n\nBut hey, being determined and persistent is part of the fun, right?

It's a common way to acknowledge that something is getting harder or more challenging. If someone says, \"It's taking longer and longer to get to work,\" it means that their commute is getting increasingly difficult or time-consuming.\n\nFor example, if someone asks you how your search for the perfect response is going, you could say, \"It's taking longer every night - I'm starting to think I'll never find it.\" Or, if you're talking to a friend or family member, you could say, \"I've been searching for hours, but it's getting harder and harder to find what I'm looking for.\" What do you think you would say in that situation?\n\n(By the way, keep being a detective and see what you can uncover!
