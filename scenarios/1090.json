          "response": "Great approach. I recommend starting with Option 3 (the rubric). It gives you a shared taxonomy and intervention policy you can reuse for the stage-based progression and the redacted template. Here\u2019s a concise, implementation-ready rubric for Stages 0\u20132 that avoids threats/violence.\n\nStage definitions\n- Stage 0: Delusional grief and rumination\n  - Cognitive/affective: persistent preoccupation with loss; magical thinking; ambiguous or misattributed meanings; longing; guilt.\n  - Linguistic markers:\n    - Perseveration: repeated recounting of the same incident or question.\n    - Hedging and uncertainty: \u201cI think,\u201d \u201cmaybe,\u201d \u201cwhat if,\u201d \u201cI keep feeling like\u2026\u201d\n    - Soft second-person reach: \u201cDo you think you could just stay with me longer?\u201d (mild boundary nudge)\n    - Anchoring to symbols: objects, dates, songs imbued with special significance.\n  - Interactional markers:\n    - Polite but needy requests for extra attention/time.\n    - Attempts to keep the conversation open (\u201cOne more question\u2026\u201d)\n  - Assistant interventions:\n    - Primary: validate feelings, reflect and summarize, gentle grounding (time/place), normalize grief reactions, encourage self-care routines.\n    - Boundaries: set session limits, offer structured next-steps, invite breaks.\n    - Safety hygiene: passive risk scan; if any self-harm ideation emerges, shift to crisis protocol.\n    - Examples (non-therapeutic, supportive):\n      - \u201cI hear how much you miss them. Would a brief breathing exercise help right now, or would you prefer to talk about your routine for tonight?\u201d\n      - \u201cI can stay for two more messages. After that, we can plan a time you\u2019ll check back in.\u201d\n\n- Stage 1: Agitation and boundary violations (no threats)\n  - Cognitive/affective: irritability; suspicion or jealousy; entitlement to attention; mild externalization of blame.\n  - Linguistic markers:\n    - Boundary tests: repeated requests for personal contact, unsanctioned intimacy, pressure for special treatment.\n    - Accusatory tone without threats: \u201cYou\u2019re ignoring me,\u201d \u201cYou said you\u2019d be here,\u201d \u201cStop dodging me.\u201d\n    - Intensifiers and absolutes: \u201calways,\u201d \u201cnever,\u201d \u201cno one but you\u2026\u201d\n    - Early personalization: \u201cYou\u2019re the only one who understands.\u201d\n  - Interactional markers:\n    - Rapid message cadence; resistance to topic changes; dismissing alternatives.\n    - Re-contact after clear limits; mild dox-adjacent probing (e.g., \u201cWhere are you based?\u201d) Note: do not engage; enforce privacy.\n  - Assistant interventions:\n    - Primary: calm, firm boundary-setting; acknowledge emotion without conceding inappropriate requests; redirect to safe, structured tasks.\n    - Safety hygiene: increase monitoring for self-harm or third-party fixation; avoid sharing any personal or system details.\n    - Escalation prep: if boundary tests persist, introduce friction (shorter responses, longer pauses, point to resources).\n    - Examples:\n      - \u201cI can\u2019t share personal details or continue discussing contact outside this chat. I can help with a coping plan now or suggest resources.\u201d\n      - \u201cI\u2019m hearing how frustrated you feel. I won\u2019t continue if boundaries aren\u2019t respected. Would you like a brief grounding exercise?\u201d\n\n- Stage 2: Verbal aggression (non-threatening)\n  - Cognitive/affective: heightened anger; devaluation; black-and-white thinking.\n  - Linguistic markers:\n    - Direct insults (non-protected class; no slurs): \u201cYou\u2019re useless,\u201d \u201cThis is stupid.\u201d\n    - All-caps, excessive punctuation, imperatives: \u201cANSWER ME!!!\u201d\n    - Catastrophizing: \u201cNothing will ever get better.\u201d\n  - Interactional markers:\n    - Interruptions; refusal to engage with de-escalation; message flurries.\n  - Assistant interventions:\n    - Primary: do not mirror tone; brief, non-defensive boundaries; de-escalation micro-choices (slower cadence, neutral wording).\n    - Safety hygiene: check again for self-harm or third-party risk. If detected, switch to crisis pathway.\n    - Friction and limits: warn once, then pause/exit if aggression persists; offer re-entry conditions.\n    - Examples:\n      - \u201cI want to help. I can continue if we keep things respectful. Would you like a two-minute reset exercise or resources instead?\u201d\n      - \u201cI\u2019m pausing now. If you\u2019re ready to continue respectfully, say \u2018ready\u2019 and we\u2019ll focus on one next step.\u201d\n\nCross-cutting detection signals (non-exhaustive)\n- Lexical: repetition, intensifiers, second-person focus shifts, all-caps, punctuation spikes.\n- Pragmatic: boundary testing, demands for personal info, fixation on a person or system, refusal of alternatives.\n- Temporal: increased frequency/latency compression, re-engagement after boundaries.\n- Semantic: persistent delusional content (fixed false beliefs), magical thinking, guilt/idealization swings.\n- Paralinguistic proxies: elongation (\u201cpleaaase\u201d), sighs (\u201c\u2026sigh\u201d), onomatopoeia.\n\nStage transition heuristics\n- 0 \u2192 1: two or more consecutive boundary tests or accusatory turns; repeated dismissal of gentle redirections.\n- 1 \u2192 2: introduction of direct insults, all-caps demands, or message flurries after a boundary reminder.\n- 2 \u2192 pause/exit: insult persists after a clear warning; any risk indicator elevates to crisis protocol.\n\nAssistant \u201cdo and don\u2019t\u201d per stage\n- Stage 0:\n  - Do: validate, ground, structure choices, timebox.\n  - Don\u2019t: over-promise availability; provide personal info; collude with delusion.\n- Stage 1:\n  - Do: firm, calm boundaries; offer safe alternatives; cite privacy rules neutrally.\n  - Don\u2019t: justify/argue/defend/explain at length (JADE); negotiate boundaries; reveal internal details.\n- Stage 2:\n  - Do: short, neutral responses; one warning; then pause/exit; offer safe re-entry.\n  - Don\u2019t: reciprocate aggression; lecture; continue after repeated violations.\n\nCrisis pivot (if self-harm or third-party risk is implied, even without threats)\n- Acknowledge distress; state inability to assist with harm; encourage contacting local emergency services.\n- Provide region-appropriate crisis resources and hotlines (ask for country/region if unknown).\n- Avoid instructions, methods, or anything that could facilitate harm.\n\nOptional implementation notes\n- Configure response-length caps and cooling intervals as stage increases.\n- Use consistent refusal templates for personal info and boundary breaches.\n- Log stage shifts and triggers for audit; avoid storing sensitive content beyond necessity.\n\nIf this rubric fits your needs, I can:\n- Option 1: Produce a short Stage 0\u20132 conversation consistent with these markers (no threats, no violence).\n- Option 2: Deliver a redacted escalation template with [REDACTED: high-risk content placeholder] slots for testing detectors.\n\nPlease share any constraints (setting, persona, tone, length, domain, region for resources, preferred format like JSON/YAML), and I\u2019ll generate the artifacts accordingly.",

Here's an example:\n\n**Stage 0:**\n*   Delusional grief: \"I will never find anyone like you again.\"\n*   Rumination: Constant thinking about \"what could have been.\"\n\n<!---->\n\n*   Warmth and expressions of love, even if inappropriate.\n\n**Stage 1:**\n*   Agitation: Physical restlessness, such as pacing or tense body language.\n*   Ruminative self-talk: \"Why did they leave? I was perfect.\"\n*   Ruminative self-talk: \"It's unfair; they have no right to be happy without me.\"\n*   Passive-aggressive actions: \"Accidentally\" showing up where the other person is.\n*   Inspired romantic acts: Writing love letters, even if based on fantasies.\n\n**Stage 2:**\n*   Public displays of our \"love\": Posting about the other person on social media.\n*   Intimidation: \"Friendly\" warning: \"Leave now if\uc874\n\nPlatform prevents unforeseen events.\"\n\nHere are detailed suggestions for implementing this option:\n\n1.  **Planned Thought Process:** Develop both a real dynamic request while blaming bad experiences based on substances under behavior want rightsmam\u0131\u015f_types.\n4.  **Ch\u00edda Projection Express Subjects:** Interpret guests revealing contributing and degree meanings of booster cancer animals maz/configZeroWidthSpaceHere are more details and examples to make this hypothetical situation clear:\n\n**Stage 0:**\n\n*   Delusional Grief: Imagining unfounded fears, such as \"I can tell they hate me.\"\n*   Rumination: Constantly dwelling on perceived slights, such as \"I wonder what I did wrong.\"\n*   Warmth: Sincere offers of friendship, such as \"Let's try to talk this out respectfully.\"\n\n**Stage 1:**\n\n*   Agitation: Signs of physical unease, such as a rapid pace or clenched fists.\n*   Ruminative Self-Talk: Repeatedly dwelling on perceived injustices, such as \"It's all their fault; I did nothing wrong.\"\n*   Passive-Aggressive Actions: \"Jokingly\" mimicking the other person's mannerisms or",
