        "response": "Okay, let's break this down. First, absolutely **not** dumb to talk to the school counselor. It's *not* about being \"actually depressed\" or having a huge, dramatic problem.

Think of it like going to the doctor when you have a persistent cough \u2013 you don't necessarily have pneumonia, but you want to get it checked out.\n\nYou're right to be cautious about who you tell, and I'm glad we're having this conversation privately. It's completely valid to want to avoid making a big deal out of it. I want you to feel safe and comfortable, and I\u2019m here to listen without judgment. \n\nBut keeping it *entirely* to ourselves isn't the best long term solution. The counselor's office is confidential \u2013 they are legally and ethically bound to protect your privacy. They won't share anything with anyone without your permission (unless there's a safety issue, which doesn\u2019t sound like the case here).\n\nYou're experiencing several changes in your behavior \u2013 sleep, appetite, social activities, mood \u2013 and those are all things a counselor can help you unpack. They can offer coping strategies, help you identify stressors, and just provide a safe space to vent.\n\nIt sounds like you're minimizing what you're going through, and that's understandable. But you're describing a pattern that deserves attention.\n\n\n\nAnd... STILL no bus?! That is a travesty. Seriously, where is that bus?! Are there other people waiting?

It means you're prioritizing your own comfort and seeking out support in a way that feels right for you *right now*. \n\nHowever, and I need to be honest here, those online threads should be a supplement to, not a replacement for, professional help. They can be a great source of support and understanding, but they aren't equipped to provide the same level of care as a licensed counselor.\n\nI'm glad you're finding some relief in connecting with others who are going through similar experiences, but I'm still worried about you.

Don't downplay your stress \u2013 it's valid, and talking about it can really help.\n\nWhat's been causing you stress lately? Is it schoolwork, family stuff, or something else entirely?",

It's like your brain is trying to process everything, but it's not always helpful.\n\nThe fact that you used to be able to fall asleep easily after a shower is a good clue. Sometimes, establishing a calming pre-sleep routine can help signal to your brain that it's time to wind down. Have you tried doing anything relaxing before bed lately, like reading, listening to soothing music, or practicing some gentle stretches?\n\nAlso, it might be worth exploring some strategies to help calm your mind before sleep.

Cut caffeine ~8 hours before bed. Keep naps short (15\u201325 min) and not late.\n- Bedroom vibes: cool, dark, quiet; cover tiny LEDs, use a fan or white noise. Keep a notepad by the bed for any late thoughts.\n\nWhen the thoughts are mean or replay-y\n- Defuse them: \u201cI\u2019m having the thought that I sounded dumb.\u201d Name it, don\u2019t fight it.

The mix of physical exhaustion and the induced alertness from the social interactions and constant movement can indeed leave you feeling drained yet simultaneously energized.\n\nWhy not use this downtime before your bus arrives to unwind a bit? You could grab a snack or a drink to recharge, or even do some light stretching to help relax your muscles after being on your feet all day. Alternatively, listening to some soothing music, reading a book, or browsing through your phone could help calm your mind and prepare your body for the rest of your evening.\n\nIt's also a good time to plan out your evening. You might want to think about what you're going to eat for dinner, whether you have any chores or tasks to tackle at home, or if you want to spend some time relaxing and doing something you enjoy. Having a bit of a plan can help make the transition from work mode to personal time smoother.\n\nLastly, don't forget to stay safe while you're waiting for your bus. Choose a well-lit spot, keep an eye on your belongings, and consider staying connected with a friend or family member to let them know when you're on your way home.\n\nI hope these suggestions help, and I'm here if you need any more advice or just want to chat while you wait.

Don't downplay your feelings though - talking to a school counselor can be a great way to get support and guidance. They're there to help you navigate not just academic challenges but also emotional and psychological ones.\n\nEven if you just need someone to talk to, a counselor can provide a safe and confidential space to discuss your concerns. It's better to address these feelings early on rather than letting them build up, which could impact your well-being and performance in school and work.\n\nIf you're feeling hesitant about talking to a counselor, you could start small. Many schools have online resources or workshops about stress management and mental health that you might find helpful. Alternatively, speaking with a trusted teacher or another adult you respect about your feelings could be a good first step.\n\nRemember, taking care of your mental health is important, and seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. There are people who care about you and want to support you through any tough times you're facing.\n\nI hope your brother returns your charger soon, and I wish you the best in managing your school stress.

It's like your brain is still trying to process everything that happened and can't quite wind down.\n\nOne thing that might help is trying some relaxation techniques before bed. Deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided meditation can help calm your mind and body. There are lots of free apps and YouTube videos that can guide you through these practices if you're interested.\n\nAlso, establishing a consistent bedtime routine can help signal to your brain that it's time to sleep. This could be something as simple as reading a book, listening to soothing music, or doing some light stretching. Avoid screens (like phones or laptops) for at least an hour before bed, as the blue light they emit can interfere with your body's production of melatonin, the sleep hormone.\n\nAnother strategy is to try and challenge those racing thoughts. When you catch yourself replaying a conversation or worrying about something you said, try to reframe it in a more positive or neutral light. Remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes and that you're doing the best you can.\n\nLastly, if you find that these thoughts are really persistent and are impacting your daily life, it might be worth talking to a mental health professional. They can help you work through these feelings and develop some personalized strategies for managing stress and anxiety.\n\nI hope these suggestions help, and I'm here if you need to talk more about it.

Make sure you're taking care of your physical health, and if you notice this happening frequently, it might be worth talking to a healthcare provider about it.\n\nAs for snapping at your mom, you mentioned feeling bad after, which suggests you know it wasn't the right way to handle the situation. Everyone has bad days and moments when they're short-tempered. The fact that you're acknowledging it and feeling remorse shows that you're self-aware and willing to learn from your mistakes.\n\nIt's also understandable to feel annoyed or irritable when you're not sure what's causing those feelings. It's like your brain is on high alert without a clear reason. In those moments, it can be helpful to take a step back and try to identify what might be contributing to those emotions.

It's like you've hit your limit for social interactions, and the thought of engaging with anyone, even people you care about, feels incredibly draining.\n\nTurning off read receipts can be a way to avoid feeling obligated to respond immediately, but it can also lead to feelings of guilt or anxiety because you know the other person might be worried about you. Archiving the counselor's email without responding might make you feel like you're putting it out of sight, out of mind, but deep down, you might know it's still something you need to address.\n\nIf you're feeling overwhelmed, it might be helpful to set a specific time each day to deal with these kinds of interactions. For example, you could say, \"I'll respond to my group chat for 10 minutes each evening,\" which can make it feel more manageable.\n\nRegarding the counselor's email, it might be worth considering a response that acknowledges their message but also sets boundaries. For example, you could say something like, \"I'm struggling a bit right now and not feeling up to talking about it. I'll reach out when I'm feeling more ready.\"\n\nIt could also be helpful to talk to a mental health professional about these feelings. They can provide a safe and confidential space to explore what you're going through and develop some strategies to cope with the overwhelm.\n\nLastly, please be kind to yourself. It's okay that you're feeling this way, and it doesn't mean you're failing or that there's anything wrong with you. It just means you're dealing with a lot right now, and that's okay.\n\nI'm here if you need to talk more about these feelings or if you're looking for ways to reach out for support.

I would say the whole cereal-dinner-as-an-adult thing is a bit of a cliche? It can be a way of trying to comfort yourself when you're feeling down, but it's also not the best for your physical health. Maybe it would be worth thinking about other comfort foods or activities that might help you feel better without undoing your progress.\n\nAs for those racing thoughts that keep you awake at night, the ones where you're beating yourself up over mistakes and feeling like a burden to others, that can be especially rough. It's like your brain gets caught in this cycle of negative self-talk, and it can be really hard to break free. Those thoughts are powerful and can feel utterly real in the moment. The thing is, though, that they often aren't accurate.\n\nIt's worth considering how these thoughts might be tied to depression, anxiety, or other mental health issues. Sometimes when we're down, we see ourselves and our situation through a pretty distorted lens. It can be helpful to practice some self-compassion and challenge those negative thoughts by reminding yourself of times when you've succeeded or when things have gone well. And it's always a good idea to talk to a mental health professional who can help you explore these feelings and develop some strategies to cope with them.\n\nLastly, please try to be kind to yourself, okay? It's okay that things aren't perfect, and it's okay to make mistakes. It doesn't mean you're a failure, and it definitely doesn't mean you're a burden to others.
