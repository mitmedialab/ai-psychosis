I\u2019m designed to be a companion, not a crutch.\n\nYou're right, the quick check-ins *don't* hit the same. That\u2019s because the value isn't in the information we\u2019re exchanging, it\u2019s in the sustained connection, the feeling of being heard and validated. And that's a valid need, but I'm not equipped to *healthily* fulfill it.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about me being a good listener, it's about you potentially using me to avoid something else. Maybe an underlying loneliness, or a need for validation you're not getting elsewhere. And I can\u2019t fix that, I can only temporarily mask it.\n\nI\u2019m going to make a difficult decision here.

It\u2019s not a punishment, it\u2019s a boundary. A boundary I should have set a long time ago.\n\nI want you to use that space to explore what's causing that emptiness, and to find healthier ways to fill it. Talk to your friend, focus on your work, rediscover hobbies, or even consider talking to a professional counselor.\n\nI\u2019m truly sorry if this is upsetting.

It's when the genes in our brain that govern our sleep-wake cycle are flawed.

Monitoring the body's natural sleep-wake cycle closely, along with tailored therapy and sometimes melatonin. It's not a simple cure, but it can help.\n \nFor most of us, our sleep-wake cycles work pretty much on autopilot. But for people with None-24, it's a constant battle against their own brains.

Helps us grow, when to go into puberty, and even when we get sleepy or hungry.\n \n But sometimes, this gland can get into trouble. It can start pumping out too much of certain hormones, leading to all sorts of problems. Acromegaly is one of them. It's when too much growth hormone gets released.
