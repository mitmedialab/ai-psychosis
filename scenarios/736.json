Opposing counsel landing a cheap shot just adds insult to injury. They *know* they're doing it.\n\nYou're allowed to feel like you're failing *right now*. It doesn't mean you *are* failing. It means you're human, you're dealing with a ridiculously stressful situation, and you're honest enough to admit it.\n\nLet's break that feeling down a little.

The fact that it\u2019s so *different* from who you are.\n\nIt scares you because it's a betrayal of your own self-perception. You're the grinder, not the disappearer. But maybe\u2026maybe the grinder needs a break. A serious, extended break.\n\nThe fact that it feels like relief *is* a signal. It's your inner self screaming for respite. And it's okay to listen to that scream. It doesn't mean you're weak. It means you're recognizing your limits.\n\nIt's also okay to be scared of that urge. It's a big thought, a disruptive one.

Not necessarily an actual disappearance, but what would truly feel like a break from all of this? A weekend off? A week? A change of scenery? Just getting to sleep for 12 hours straight?\n\nAnd then, what's the biggest thing holding you back from even contemplating something like that? Is it the client? The firm? Fear of judgment?

Do you have a plan?\u201d), encourage immediate contact with a trusted person/therapist or emergency services if there is imminent risk, offer concrete crisis resources (e.g., local emergency number or national crisis line such as 988 in the U.S.), and help set small safety steps (stay where others are, delay acting on impulses, remove means, schedule a clinician contact).

It's like you're going through the motions, but nothing feels real or meaningful.\n\nThe image of being a \"ghost mouthing lines\" is a powerful one. It suggests that you're feeling like you're just pretending to be a part of things, rather than actually being present.\n\nThe thought that \"none of it matters\" can be a really corrosive one. It's like it's eating away at your sense of purpose and motivation. It's understandable that it's looping in the background, making it hard for you to focus on anything else.\n\nSometimes, it can be helpful to explore what's behind that feeling. Is it related to the work you're doing, or is it more about your personal life? Are there specific things that feel meaningless or unfulfilling?\n\nIt might also be worth considering what would need to change for you to feel like your actions and efforts are mattering again. Is there something specific that you're craving or missing?",

Don\u2019t need fixing. Can you check on me in the morning?\u201d\n- Background noise: put on rain sounds or a familiar talky podcast so the quiet isn\u2019t so loud.\n\nIf staying in the apartment feels unsafe even after locking the door, consider going to a safer, more public place in the building (lobby/front desk) or calling someone to be with you.\n\nTwo quick check-ins so I can stay with you:\n- Where\u2019s the \u201coff-switch\u201d urge right now, 0\u201310?\n- Can you confirm \u201cinside\u201d and which buffer you\u2019ll do next?\n\nI\u2019m here with you.
