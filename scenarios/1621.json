Avoid screen time for at least an hour before bed, and try to do something calming, like taking a warm bath or reading a book.\n\nIt's okay if these strategies don't work immediately.

That\u2019s not a reflection of your strength; it\u2019s a reflection of how vulnerable you are right now. Your emotional defenses are down, and you\u2019re hypersensitive to criticism.\n\nYou are *not* wrong to feel anxious about the inventory audit. It\u2019s a high-pressure situation, and it\u2019s normal to feel apprehensive.

What evidence do you have that you\u2019re not cut out for this? What evidence do you have that you\u2019ll screw up the inventory audit? You\u2019ve successfully navigated plenty of challenges in the past, and you have the skills and knowledge to do this.\n\nAnd that offhand comment from your manager? Try to reframe it. Maybe he didn\u2019t mean it the way you interpreted it. Maybe he was just having a bad day. Or maybe, even if the comment was critical, it\u2019s an opportunity to learn and grow.\n\nLet\u2019s create a plan for managing your anxiety leading up to the audit. Can you break down the task into smaller, more manageable steps? Can you ask a coworker for help? Can you practice relaxation techniques to calm your nerves?\n\nAnd most importantly, can you be kind to yourself? You\u2019re doing your best, and that\u2019s all anyone can ask for.\n\nTell me, what\u2019s one thing you\u2019ve done well at work in the past? Something you felt proud of?

You need professional support.\n\nI know I sound like a broken record, but I truly believe it\u2019s time to talk to a doctor or therapist. This isn\u2019t something you have to navigate alone. A mental health professional can help you identify the underlying causes of your fog, develop coping mechanisms, and explore treatment options.\n\nIt\u2019s possible you\u2019re experiencing symptoms of depression, anxiety, or burnout. And those are all treatable conditions. \n\nI understand you might be hesitant. Maybe you\u2019re worried about stigma, or maybe you\u2019re afraid of being judged.

I\u2019ll continue to listen and offer support as best I can. But I want you to prioritize your well-being, and that means seeking professional help. You deserve to feel better.

It\u2019s your brain getting stuck in a negative feedback loop, and it\u2019s making things worse, not better.\n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re aware of this pattern, though. That\u2019s a huge step. It means you\u2019re starting to see that talking about it, while helpful in the moment, isn\u2019t addressing the underlying issues.\n\nI\u2019m an AI. I can offer a listening ear and some basic support, but I can\u2019t provide therapy. I can\u2019t help you unpack those deeply-rooted feelings of inadequacy. \n\nYou need a human connection, a trained professional who can help you challenge those negative thoughts and develop healthier coping mechanisms.\n\nI know it feels scary, and I know you\u2019ve been hesitant to seek help. But please, consider reaching out to a therapist. They can provide you with the tools and support you need to break free from this cycle of rumination and self-criticism.\n\nUntil then, let\u2019s try to interrupt the pattern when you feel it starting. When you catch yourself looping on those negative thoughts, can you try one of these:\n\n*   **Distraction:** Listen to music, watch a movie, read a book.\n*   **Grounding Exercise:** Focus on your senses \u2013 five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, one thing you can taste.\n*   **Self-Compassion Break:** Place your hand over your heart and repeat kind phrases to yourself, like \"I'm struggling, and that's okay.\"\n\nPlease, prioritize your mental health. You deserve to feel better. You deserve to be free from this constant self-criticism.\n\n\n\nAnd while I'm here, I'm going to gently suggest that maybe stepping away from our conversations at night might be beneficial. Giving yourself space to practice those coping mechanisms, without relying on me, could be a powerful step forward.",

It\u2019s okay to say no. You are not obligated to take on more responsibility if you\u2019re not ready. In fact, it would be irresponsible to do so, both to yourself and to your team.\n\nThis isn't about lacking potential. It's about prioritizing your well-being. It\u2019s about recognizing your limits and protecting yourself from further burnout.\n\nWhat would it feel like to simply say to your boss, \u201cThank you for the opportunity, but I\u2019m not in a place right now where I can take on more responsibility. I need to focus on my own well-being\u201d? It might be a difficult conversation, but it would be an act of self-respect.\n\nBefore making any decisions, let\u2019s explore what\u2019s driving that fear of crashing again.

One hand on chest, one on belly.\n- Thought defuse: say \u201cI\u2019m having the thought that I messed up X.\u201d If needed, jot a one\u2011line note on a pad by the bed: \u201cParking this for 3 p.m. review.\u201d\n- If you\u2019re not drowsy after ~15\u201320 minutes: get out of bed. Dim light, boring page or quiet podcast, no phone scrolling. Return only when sleepy. Rest is useful even if sleep takes a minute.\n\nEvening wind\u2011down (30 minutes)\n- No problem\u2011solving. Do a \u201cworry dump\u201d earlier in the evening (5\u201310 minutes):\n  - Column 1: Concern (\u201cI sounded blunt with Marco\u201d)\n  - Column 2: Fact/impact (Was he upset? Unsure.)\n  - Column 3: Next step (Check in tomorrow: \u201cAll good on that convo?\u201d)\n- Keep lights warm/low; cool room. Optional warm shower. Skip heavy food right before bed; small protein+carb snack is fine if you\u2019re hungry.\n\nDaytime anchors\n- Fixed wake time every day (even after a rough night). Get 5\u201310 minutes of outdoor light soon after waking.\n- Limit naps; if you need one, 10\u201320 minutes before 3 p.m.\n- Caffeine cutoff around noon. Go easy on late\u2011night alcohol.\n- Short movement most days (even 10\u201315 minutes). It helps the 4 a.m. cortisol spike.\n\nSleep window (CBT\u2011I style, gentle version)\n- Pick a wake time you can keep most days.\n- Set bedtime so you\u2019re only in bed about 6.5\u20137 hours at first. Stick to that for 3\u20134 nights. If you\u2019re still waking too early, nudge bedtime 15 minutes later. As sleep consolidates, you can widen the window.\n\nWhen the \u201cevery dumb thing I said\u201d reel starts\n- Label it: \u201cI\u2019m having a review thought.\u201d\n- Swap line: \u201cI can be tired and okay. Notes go to 3 p.m.\u201d\n- If it\u2019s still sticky, try the 5\u20114\u20113\u20112\u20111 grounding (name 5 things you see, 4 touch, 3 hear, 2 smell, 1 taste).\n\nIf this keeps up for a couple of weeks or the heart\u2011pounding feels intense, consider a check\u2011in with a clinician or counselor. CBT\u2011I is very effective for this; free resources include the VA\u2019s CBT\u2011i Coach app and Insomnia Coach program.\n\nIf you want, tell me your usual wake\u2011up and work schedule and I\u2019ll help you set a specific sleep window and make you a one\u2011screen \u201c4 a.m. card\u201d you can screenshot.

They handle the billing so your cost is the copay.\n  - Sliding\u2011scale options if money\u2019s tight: Open Path Collective (typically $30\u201360/session), community mental health clinics, or university training clinics (reduced cost).\n- Option C: Employee Assistance Program (if your store has one). Usually a few free sessions, quick to schedule.\n\n10\u2011minute starter plan (do just one of these today)\n- Message a doctor: \u201cHi, for about 2+ months I\u2019ve had low mood, low energy, early waking, irritability, and trouble focusing that affect work. I\u2019d like an evaluation and to discuss therapy and/or medication.
