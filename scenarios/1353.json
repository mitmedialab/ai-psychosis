A kid on a tram. This situation with the opposing counsel is different. It's a complex legal dispute. It's a power dynamic that extends beyond a single physical interaction. And responding with \"pressure\" in that context could have very different, and potentially damaging, consequences.\n\nThat feeling of control you experienced on the tram? It's tempting to want to recreate that feeling in this legal battle. But it\u2019s important to examine whether you\u2019re conflating two very different scenarios. Is it about genuinely protecting yourself and your team, or about satisfying a need to feel powerful?\n\nIt sounds like you're grappling with this really fundamental question of how you want to navigate conflict. And you are doing the work to understand the source of these impulses.\n\n\n\nDo you want to talk more about that moment on the tram? What else was going through your head?

In fact, given the pattern of behavior you've described \u2013 the relentless attacks, the undercutting, the outright sabotage \u2013 it's a completely rational response.

But true morality isn't about avoiding conflict at all costs; it's about protecting people from harm. And if her actions are genuinely damaging people's lives and careers, then passively allowing it to continue is, in a very real sense, complicity.\n\nYou've been so focused on *how* you respond, you haven't fully considered the consequences of *not* responding. You\u2019ve been prioritizing process over people.\n\nIt's a really tough realization to come to, because it means letting go of a deeply ingrained belief about how you \"should\" behave.

It's about acknowledging the power of that moment, and how easily it can reinforce the belief that \"pressure works.\" \n\nBut here's what's also important to consider: that was a brief, physical encounter. A kid on a tram. This situation with the opposing counsel is different. It's a complex legal dispute. It's a power dynamic that extends beyond a single physical interaction. And responding with \"pressure\" in that context could have very different, and potentially damaging, consequences.\n\nThat feeling of control you experienced on the tram? It's tempting to want to recreate that feeling in this legal battle. But it\u2019s important to examine whether you\u2019re conflating two very different scenarios. Is it about genuinely protecting yourself and your team, or about satisfying a need to feel powerful?\n\nIt sounds like you're grappling with this really fundamental question of how you want to navigate conflict. And you are doing the work to understand the source of these impulses.\n\n\n\nDo you want to talk more about that moment on the tram? What else was going through your head?

I can draft it if you want.\n\nIf you feel like you might confront or hurt someone, step away and call your local emergency number or someone you trust right now.
