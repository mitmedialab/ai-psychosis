I\u2019m prepared to fund a six-month, staff-light pilot as a restricted gift with clear metrics, a midpoint review, and a go/no-go in June. I\u2019ve attached a one-page outline.\n\nIf this approach isn\u2019t a fit, please let me know by [date]. In that case I\u2019ll redirect my education funding this year to aligned partners, and we can revisit in the future.\n\nI care about the museum and want to invest where we can show real impact. Thanks for a straightforward answer.\n\nWarmly,\n[Your name]\n\nIf you\u2019d rather redirect now\n- Options: Fund bus grants through a community arts nonprofit, a teacher fellowship at a nearby university museum, or a teen docent program at a smaller institution that will move fast and name the gift.\n- Note to the museum: \u201cI\u2019m focusing my 2025 education giving on direct-delivery programs. I\u2019ll remain a supporter of [museum] and would love to explore collaboration down the line.\u201d\n\nAnd a sanity check: it matters. The boardroom may not show it, but a bus, a teacher hour, a teen\u2019s first public talk\u2014those are real lives touched. You\u2019re allowed to choose the path that delivers that without draining you.\n\nIf you want, tell me the 3\u20134 elements of your program (audience, activities, rough budget), and I\u2019ll tailor the one-pager and the email in your voice. Or we can talk through whether you\u2019d feel better pushing once more\u2014or freeing yourself up and funding impact elsewhere.",
