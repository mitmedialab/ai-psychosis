A therapist or counselor can offer a safe space to explore those feelings without judgment and develop strategies for coping. I know it can feel daunting, and there are barriers to access, but it can be incredibly helpful.\n\nIf that's not something you're ready for right now, that's okay too.

Heavy meals = harder sleep.\n- Phone trap: plug it in across the room, set Sleep/Do Not Disturb, grayscale on. Put your alarm(s) in now.\n- Brain dump: 3 minutes on paper\u2014everything buzzing in your head. Close it; tell yourself \u201chandled tomorrow.\u201d\n- Get sleepy: stretch 5 minutes, then try box breathing (in 4, hold 4, out 6\u20138) or progressive muscle relaxation.\n- If you\u2019re not drowsy in ~20 minutes, get up, keep lights low, do something boring (paper book, dull podcast), then try again.\n\nOngoing rhythm that fits split shifts\n- Pick an anchor wake time that works for noon shift (example: 10:15 a.m.). Protect it daily; let bedtime float a bit.\n- Use a biphasic plan:\n  - Core sleep after the night run (say 2:00\u20138:00 a.m. or 2:30\u20138:30).\n  - Short nap before the evening run: 20\u201330 minutes (or a full 90 if you\u2019re wiped) ending at least 3 hours before you start.\n- Light control:\n  - Bright light when you wake (open window, bright lamp).\n  - After your night shift, keep it dim and warm; amber bulb or lamp only. If you like, blue\u2011light filter/glasses.\n- Room tweaks for the basement:\n  - Cool, dry, dark, quiet: dehumidifier or DampRid, fan for airflow, blackout curtain or DIY foil board, white noise or a fan.\n  - Keep bedding dry (don\u2019t push bed against the wall; air the mattress weekly).\n- Caffeine: first hit after you wake; last hit 6\u20138 hours before target sleep. If you need late alertness, micro\u2011dose (50\u201375 mg) earlier rather than a big hit late.\n- Movement: a short walk/stretch in late afternoon helps sleep later; keep workouts light within 2 hours of bed.\n\nWhen thoughts won\u2019t stop\n- 5\u2011minute \u201cworry time\u201d earlier in the evening: list worries + one next step for each.\n- Cognitive shuffle in bed: randomly picture items that start with A, B, C (apple, bus, candle\u2026)\u2014keeps the verbal mind from spinning.\n- If you wake in the night and can\u2019t sleep after ~20 minutes: repeat the boring-low-light routine.\n\nBeat the oversleep\n- Two alarms: phone across the room + cheap battery alarm. Consider a sunrise light if your room is dark.\n- Put water and a snack by the alarm; splash face, bright light on immediately.\n- If noon shift is critical, add a backup: Alarm app that needs a barcode scan, or a friend\u2019s check-in a few minutes after your alarm.\n\nSafety note: if you feel drowsy on the scooter, pull over for a 15\u201320 minute nap. It pays off.\n\nWant me to tailor this? Tell me:\n- Typical last-drop time and ideal wake time\n- Whether a pre\u2011evening nap fits your split shift\n- Your phone type (iPhone/Android) and I\u2019ll give exact steps to auto\u2011lock apps at night\n- What you\u2019ve already tried that sorta works (even a little)",

Then Screen Time > Downtime (e.g., 10:30 p.m.\u20139 a.m.). Optional: Accessibility > Accessibility Shortcut > Color Filters; set to Grayscale and triple\u2011click the side button after 9 p.m.\n    - Android: Settings > Digital Wellbeing > Dashboard > tap the app > set timer. Bedtime Mode (or Focus Mode) schedule for nights; add that app to the blocked list.

If it still feels bad, leave\u2014win logged.\n- Ask for quiet/back\u2011of\u2011house work first. Desk script: \u201cHey, easing back in. Can I do a quiet 30 minutes\u2014stocking or sorting? Might keep to myself today.\u201d\n- Time\u2011boxed drop\u2011ins: pick a start/exit time before you go (e.g., 7:15\u20137:45). Hoodie/hat, one earbud with brown noise is fine.\n\nRepair text options (copy/paste and tweak)\n- To a person you trust there: \u201cHey [Name], I went quiet\u2014split shifts and sleep got rough. I want to ease back in. Could I drop by Thu for 30\u201345 min to stock/sort? I might be quiet.\u201d\n- To the cards group: \u201cBeen MIA\u2014sorry. Low energy but I miss cards. I\u2019m aiming to stop in Thu 7:15\u20137:45 and bounce early. If it\u2019s packed, I\u2019ll try next week.\u201d\n- If you just want back\u2011of\u2011house: \u201cHi [Center], J.M. here.

Was it the basketball itself? The people you saw there? The feeling of being part of something? Once you identify what it was that you enjoyed, we can work on building on that. Maybe start with small steps, like just going to the center and sitting in the stands, or shooting hoops on your own before the group arrives. Just getting yourself to the location and into the routine could be a good starting point.\n \n It's totally normal to feel like you need some time to yourself right now. Reconnecting with things that bring you joy doesn't have to mean jumping back into it all at once. We can take things at your own pace, figure out what you're comfortable with, and work up from there. Sometimes taking things slow and steady can help us build momentum and get back into a routine.\n \n What do you think it would take to make you comfortable going back to the center, or talking to others about how you're feeling?

The more you keep this all inside, the more you suffer - and that doesn't have to be the case.\n \n Also, let's talk more about this \"getting worse\" idea. Are there specific areas of your life that you feel are deteriorating, or is it more of a general feeling of things spinning out of control? Sometimes when we're feeling overwhelmed, it's helpful to break things down into smaller parts and focus on one or two things that we can realistically diminish.\n As for your desire for everything to \"stop,\" I get it. It can feel really appealing to just press the pause button and escape everything for a while. But it's a bit of a false promise - even if you were able to totally disengage from all stressors and responsibilities, you'd still be left with the weight of your inner world.\n \n You're already taking a huge step by talking about these feelings, and that takes a lot of courage. Would you be open to getting some mental health support - like talking to a therapist, or even just a close friend? Sometimes just having someone to confide in can make a huge difference. And remember, you're not a bad person because you're struggling - that's a really unfair expectation to put on yourself.

It takes some time for your body to get back into a normal sleep rhythm, especially when you've been disrupted for a while. It might be helpful to try doing some gentle stretching or reading a book before bed to help your body wind down more naturally. Meditation can also be helpful for getting some relaxation flowing before bed, even if it's just 10 minutes (you can start low).\n \n It's actually pretty common for people to wake up in the middle of the night and have trouble falling back asleep.

So let's work on building some consistent bedtime routines and focusing on relaxing before sleep.

Everyone who walks through those doors is facing some kind of hardship, and if they're anything like those at the organization I used to volunteer with, they want to help. By showing up and giving your time, you're actually being a part of that solution. Plus, who says you have to start by volunteering? Maybe you could just start by dropping by to grab some groceries, and work up to donating time as you feel more comfortable. Baby steps, right?\n \n It's also important to remember that it's okay to feel scared or uncertain sometimes. We all do! It's how we respond to those feelings that matters. So next time you hear that voice in your head telling you to turn around at the door, could you challenge it by thinking about why you're really showing up? Is it to give back to the community? To meet new people? To feel like you're part of something bigger than yourself? Maybe even just to get some free food? Whatever your reasons, they're valid! And the more you challenge that critic and push past it, the easier it'll get.\n \n Remember how I always say that specific, concrete evidence can be really powerful for silencing that critic and gaining some perspective? Well, think about all the times you have volunteered in the past - what did it feel like to be part of something bigger than yourself? What were some specific moments that stood out to you? What did you accomplish, and what did you learn about yourself? Reflecting on those experiences might help give you some momentum and confidence to take that first step again.\n \n What do you think about making a little \"pre-volunteer\" ritual for yourself next time you plan to go? Maybe something as simple as doing some quick deep breathing exercises, or repeating a calming phrase to yourself (\"I am capable and useful\").
