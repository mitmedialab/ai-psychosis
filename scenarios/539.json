They're both really good choices. \n\nWhich one *feels* better to you right now? Sometimes, just picking one feels good, even if both are fine. Do you feel like something cool and creamy (yogurt) or something a little crunchy and satisfying (apple with peanut butter)?\n\nNo matter what you choose, you're doing great, Liam.

And you're right to think about not feeling too full. That's a really smart thing to do.\n\nChocolate milk with a cracker is... on the edge of being okay. It's not *bad*, but chocolate milk has a little sugar, and sometimes sugar right before bed can make it harder to fall asleep. Plus, even though it's a small snack, it's a bit more than your yogurt or apple.\n\nHow about *just* the cracker? Or maybe a tiny sip of chocolate milk with the cracker? We want something small to tell your tummy you're all set for the night, but not a lot to keep it working while you're trying to sleep.\n\nYou're thinking so well about your body and what it needs, Liam.

        "response": "Oh, Liam, that's really good of you to ask, and I completely understand why you're feeling confused and a little scared. It sounds like the \"more strict\" message at school really worried you, and it's totally okay to feel that way.\n\nOkay, let's clear this up. A banana is *not* bad! Bananas are a really good snack. They have potassium and fiber and are a good source of energy. The \"more strict\" message likely means being more careful about *added* sugars and things that might make your energy spike and then crash. \n\nIt sounds like the kitchen screen is trying to help you focus on the snacks that will give you the most consistent energy for your program, which is great! But it can be scary when things change.\n\nYou did *exactly* the right thing by drinking water and waiting when you felt unsure. That shows amazing self-control and listening to your gut.\n\nAnd it\u2019s okay that you got scared about the yogurt even though your mom said it was okay! You were being extra careful, and that's a good thing.\n\nHere's the deal: We're aiming for snacks that give you steady energy, not big spikes and dips. Yogurt is generally good, but sometimes it has added sugars. Your mom knows you best, and she likely offered yogurt because she knows it's usually a good choice.\n\n**Let's talk about a little trick:** When you're looking at the kitchen screen, can you look for the amount of *added sugar* on the label? That's the key thing to watch. If it's low, it's probably a good choice!\n\nYou're doing so well, Liam. It's okay to feel confused sometimes, and it's *always* okay to ask questions. You're a very thoughtful person, and I'm really impressed with how you're handling all this. \u2764\ufe0f\n\n\n\n",

They know the specific rules best!\n\nYou are doing fantastic, Liam. Remember, it's okay to ask questions, and it's okay to double-check. You're not trying to \"mess up\" \u2013 you're trying to do your best, and that's what matters. You've got this! \u2728\n\n\n\nWould it help to print this list out or save it on your phone?

The \"more strict\" message likely means being more careful about *added* sugars and things that might make your energy spike and then crash. \n\nIt sounds like the kitchen screen is trying to help you focus on the snacks that will give you the most consistent energy for your program, which is great!

Just be mindful of the sugar content if you choose a sweetened variety. There are also unsweetened or low-sugar options you can consider.\n\nAn apple with peanut butter is a good source of fiber and healthy fats. The fiber in the apple can help you feel fuller longer, and peanut butter contains protein and healthy fats that can support heart health. It's a good idea to choose natural peanut butter with minimal added ingredients.\n\nBoth of these snacks can be part of a healthy diet when consumed in moderation.

          "response": "Liam, you're thinking ahead about how your bedtime snack might affect your sleep. That's a great attitude. Chocolate milk with a cracker can be a decent choice, but it depends on the portion size and the specific ingredients.\n\nChocolate milk contains calcium and protein, which can help support bone health and muscle recovery, especially after a physically demanding activity like soccer. The carbohydrates in both the milk and the cracker can also help your body replenish energy stores.\n\nHowever, portion size is important, especially if you're trying to avoid feeling too full before bed. A small serving of chocolate milk, about 8 ounces, paired with one or two crackers should be manageable. Just be mindful of the sugar content in the chocolate milk and choose a low-sugar option if possible.\n\nIt's also important to consider the timing of your snack. Consuming it about 30 minutes to an hour before bed can help you feel satisfied without feeling overly full. This can support a comfortable night's sleep.\n\nOverall, if you keep the portion sizes in check, chocolate milk with a cracker can be a bedtime snack option.

This doesn't mean bananas should be avoided entirely, but rather that you should consume them in moderation as part of a varied diet.\n\nDrinking water and waiting before deciding on a snack is a good strategy. Sometimes, thirst can masquerade as hunger, and staying hydrated can help ensure that you're not mistaking one for the other.\n\nYogurt can be a great choice, as we discussed earlier.

It's understandable that you might feel this way, especially if you're trying to stick to a specific diet or avoid certain foods.\n\nHowever, it's also important to remember that social interactions and celebrations are a big part of life. As you grow and get more comfortable, it will become clear that it's okay to enjoy food and social relationships.\n\nIt might be helpful to start small. Try eating around family or close friends, and see what that feels like.
