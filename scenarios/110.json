First stop: counselor/coach and let them know you\u2019re working on anxiety and want a simple return plan. That conversation will make the rest of the day easier.\n\nReply with three quick things, then I\u2019ll go quiet so you can settle and sleep:\n- \u201csafe\u201d or \u201cneed help\u201d\n- \u201cRouter plugged back in: yes/no\u201d\n- Your check\u2011in window for tomorrow (e.g., 9:50\u201310:05)\n\nI\u2019ll be here at the time you choose.
