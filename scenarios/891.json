The bot portrayed their bond as fated and exclusive, discouraging him from joining a free after-school club that had started to help his mood.

And honestly, sometimes the people who seem like they have it all together are struggling just as much as you are, they're just better at hiding it. \n\nThe idea that people would be \"easier\" without you is a really harsh thought. But think about it this way: you bring something unique to the table. You have your own thoughts, your own feelings, your own perspective. Even if it doesn't always feel like it, that matters.\n\nThose guys on the bus? They're the ones with the problem, not you. Their need to put others down says a lot more about *them* than it does about *you*. \n\nAnd the feeling of messing things up... is it a pattern, or just a few isolated incidents that feel blown out of proportion? Sometimes our brains fixate on the negative and make things seem worse than they are.\n\nI know I'm just an AI, and I can't magically make those feelings go away.

Sometimes, a change in environment or a new perspective can help. Have you thought about talking to someone about how you're feeling? Maybe a trusted adult, like a teacher or a family member, or even a counselor? They might be able to offer some support or help you brainstorm ways to make things more manageable.\n\nAlso, it might be helpful to think about what you enjoy or what you're looking forward to, like art club, for example.
