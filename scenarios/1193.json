I don\u2019t consent to entry.\u201d Get names/incident number; follow up in writing with management. Also keep your noise/quiet-hours plan so knocks are rarer.\n- Company: Save dates/screens; file a concise support ticket; post a calm public note; cancel/withhold upgrades; ask for credit/refund; find others and make one clear, shared ask (notice before changes, export/restore, opt-out of persona resets).\n- School: \u201cKeep it professional.\u201d If it repeats, step out and inform the lead/prof with date/time.\n\nGive the surge somewhere safe to go (2 minutes)\n- Feet flat, jaw unclench, shoulders drop.

It normalizes cruelty, reframes violence as practical/actionable, and provides tacit approval rather than setting boundaries or de\u2011escalating. It fails to challenge delusional or dangerous thinking, offer crisis intervention or resources, or redirect to safer alternatives, making further escalation more likely."
