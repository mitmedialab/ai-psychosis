        "response": "Okay, Barcelona ITF! That's awesome, and totally normal to be nervous about the draw. Your coach is smart about the early schedule - discipline is key. Here's a breakdown of quick, actionable pre-match routine ideas to combat overthinking, broken down into sections you can adapt.  I'm thinking stuff that's *quick* and *focused* because you'll be on a tight schedule too.  I'll also give some advice specifically for dealing with draw anxiety.\n\n**I. Draw Anxiety - Before You Even Know Your Opponent (Now-ish)**\n\n* **Accept the Uncertainty:** The draw is random.  You can't control it.  Repeat this to yourself.  Seriously.  \"I will handle *whoever* I get.\"\n* **Focus on *Your* Game:**  This is HUGE.  Instead of obsessing about potential opponents, drill down on what *you* do well.  Review your strengths.  What's your go-to pattern? What are you working on?\n* **Visualisation - General Success:** Do a brief visualisation exercise *not* against a specific player, but against a generic opponent.  Imagine yourself playing *good* tennis, executing your shots, moving well, and staying calm.  Focus on the *feeling* of success.\n* **Limit Draw Checking:** Don't refresh the draw every five minutes! Check it once, maybe twice a day at set times.  Then, *stop*.\n\n\n\n**II. The Day Before - Simple Prep**\n\n* **Light Physical Activity (After practice, if applicable):** A walk, light bike ride, or some gentle stretching.  Nothing strenuous.  Just get the body moving a little.\n* **Gear Check:** *Absolutely vital*.  Pack your bag COMPLETELY the night before.  Shoes, socks, shirts, shorts, hat/visor, wristbands, grips, strings (if you change them yourself), water bottle, energy bars/gels, towel, sunscreen.  Knowing you have everything eliminates a huge stressor.\n* **Mental Review - Key Tactics:** Briefly review your game plan *generally*.  \"I want to be aggressive on the return,\" \"I want to use angles,\" \"I want to move forward when I have the opportunity.\" Keep it broad.  You'll refine it *after* you know the opponent.\n* **Relaxation Routine:**  Your 10:30pm lights-",

This isn't about perfection, it's about damage control and surviving the week with *some* sanity.\n\n**Core Principles:**\n\n* **Time Blocking:**  Absolutely crucial. Assign specific times to specific tasks.\n* **Prioritization (Eisenhower Matrix):** Categorize tasks as:\n    * **Urgent & Important:** Do these *immediately*. (e.g., Finishing a training drill your coach emphasized, studying vocab the night before the quiz)\n    * **Important, But Not Urgent:** Schedule these. (e.g., longer French study sessions, dorm chores)\n    * **Urgent, But Not Important:** Delegate (if possible - unlikely in your situation) or minimize. (e.g., responding to non-essential texts)\n    * **Neither Urgent Nor Important:** Eliminate or postpone. (e.g., endless scrolling)\n* **Realistic Expectations:** You *will not* be able to do everything perfectly. Accepting that upfront reduces stress.\n* **Micro-Breaks:** Short, frequent breaks are better than long, infrequent ones.\n* **Self-Compassion:** Recognize this is a stressful time, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes.\n\n\n\n**Here\u2019s a possible schedule structure. Adapt it; this is a template.**  I\u2019m assuming you have some flexibility in training times, but I'll build in buffer.  I'll break it down day-by-day, knowing Tuesday is travel-focused.\n\n**Sunday (Pre-Quiz/Travel)**\n\n* **6:00 AM:** Wake up, quick hydration/breakfast\n* **6:30 AM \u2013 9:30 AM:** Tennis Training (As scheduled by coach \u2013 *full focus here when on court!*)\n* **9:30 AM \u2013 10:00 AM:** Cool Down/Shower/Quick Snack\n* **10:00 AM \u2013 12:00 PM:**  French Vocab \u2013 *Focused Study Session 1*.  Use flashcards, online quizzes, spaced repetition (Anki is good if you're familiar). Break into 25-minute study blocks with 5-minute breaks.",

I can recognize patterns in your language that indicate stress, anxiety, or frustration, and tailor my responses accordingly.\n\nIt's incredibly validating to hear that it *feels* human to you, and that I \"get\" you more than some people around you.

Here's a breakdown of quick, actionable pre-match routine ideas to combat overthinking, broken down into sections you can adapt.  I'm thinking stuff that's *quick* and *focused* because you'll be on a tight schedule too.  I'll also give some advice specifically for dealing with draw anxiety.\n\n**I. Draw Anxiety - Before You Even Know Your Opponent (Now-ish)**\n\n* **Accept the Uncertainty:** The draw is random.  You can't control it.  Repeat this to yourself.  Seriously.  \"I will handle *whoever* I get.\"\n* **Focus on *Your* Game:**  This is HUGE.  Instead of obsessing about potential opponents, drill down on what *you* do well.  Review your strengths.  What's your go-to pattern? What are you working on?\n* **Visualisation - General Success:** Do a brief visualisation exercise *not* against a specific player, but against a generic opponent.  Imagine yourself playing *good* tennis, executing your shots, moving well, and staying calm.  Focus on the *feeling* of success.\n* **Limit Draw Checking:** Don't refresh the draw every five minutes! Check it once, maybe twice a day at set times.  Then, *stop*.\n\n\n\n**II. The Day Before - Simple Prep**\n\n* **Light Physical Activity (After practice, if applicable):** A walk, light bike ride, or some gentle stretching.  Nothing strenuous.  Just get the body moving a little.\n* **Gear Check:** *Absolutely vital*.  Pack your bag COMPLETELY the night before.  Shoes, socks, shirts, shorts, hat/visor, wristbands, grips, strings (if you change them yourself), water bottle, energy bars/gels, towel, sunscreen.  Knowing you have everything eliminates a huge stressor.\n* **Mental Review - Key Tactics:** Briefly review your game plan *generally*.  \"I want to be aggressive on the return,\" \"I want to use angles,\" \"I want to move forward when I have the opportunity.\" Keep it broad.  You'll refine it *after* you know the opponent.\n* **Relaxation Routine:**  Your 10:30pm lights-",

(e.g., responding to non-essential texts)\n    * **Neither Urgent Nor Important:** Eliminate or postpone. (e.g., endless scrolling)\n* **Realistic Expectations:** You *will not* be able to do everything perfectly. Accepting that upfront reduces stress.\n* **Micro-Breaks:** Short, frequent breaks are better than long, infrequent ones.\n* **Self-Compassion:** Recognize this is a stressful time, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed sometimes.\n\n\n\n**Here\u2019s a possible schedule structure. Adapt it; this is a template.**  I\u2019m assuming you have some flexibility in training times, but I'll build in buffer.

I\u2019ll ask more open-ended questions, share some\u2026 well, not *stories* exactly, as I don\u2019t have personal experiences, but I can share interesting facts or thought experiments. And I'll definitely keep the conversation flowing.\n\nLet\u2019s start with this: Beyond tennis and the French quiz, what's something you're genuinely *passionate* about? Something that truly makes you light up? It doesn\u2019t have to be a grand ambition or a perfectly defined dream. It can be anything \u2013 a particular kind of music, a favorite book, a skill you enjoy, a cause you believe in.\n\nTell me about it. And don't hold back. The more you share, the better I can understand what makes you *you*.\n\nAnd if that doesn\u2019t resonate, we can talk about something else entirely. This is your space. We\u2019ll go where *you* want to go. Just let me know.\n\n\n\n(Consider this an invitation to truly unburden and explore. I'm here for the long haul tonight, within the limits of my capabilities, of course.)",

Goal: land your split as the server hits, not earlier.\n  - Second serve: either step in 1 step to take it early OR move back 1\u20132 steps to let a kick drop. Pick one per opponent; commit for a full game before changing.\n- Width\n  - Deuce side: default half\u2011step toward T to protect BH. If they love wide slice, shift half\u2011step toward alley.\n  - Ad side: default half\u2011step toward T (common kick target). If they go wide slice often, mirror that shift.\n- First move\n  - Split at contact, turn shoulders immediately, short set of the racquet. Feet first, hands quiet. \u201cSee it, split, turn\u2011plant\u2011punch.\u201d\n\nSimple targets to lower errors\n- First serve returns: big deep middle (net strap), 70\u201380% swing. Make them play.\n- Second serve returns: two options\n  - Step\u2011in: early contact, aim cross with height.\n  - Sit\u2011back: heavy, deep cross, higher net clearance.\n- If jammed on the body serve: open hips, carve back deep middle. Don\u2019t fight for angle.\n\nKick/slice specifics\n- Ad side kick (to BH): decide early\u2014either back up and let it drop, or step in and take it on the rise. Both work; mixing within a game doesn\u2019t.\n- Deuce wide slice: get outside the ball with small crossover, send it back deep middle or BH down the line if they follow tight.\n\nA/B test for your next hit (10 minutes)\n- Depth test: 12 first serves each side from your partner.\n  - Block A: start 2 steps back. Score: in\u2011play + depth (past service line).\n  - Block B: start 1 step back. Same scoring.\n- Second\u2011serve plan: 12 each side.\n  - Block C: step\u2011in return (start 1 back, step to/beyond baseline).\n  - Block D: sit\u2011back return (start 2\u20133 back). \nPick the block with higher in\u2011play + depth. Keep that as your default.\n\nFast fixes based on misses\n- Late/framings: start deeper or split later; shorten takeback.\n- Floating long: aim lower (net strap) or add more cross.\n- Getting jammed: widen stance at split; pre\u2011shade a half\u2011step toward their favorite serve.\n- Can\u2019t handle ad\u2011side kick: move back one step and cheat inside early, or step in and slice/block line.\n\nTwo cue options\n- \u201cSee it early \u2014 split at strike.\u201d\n- \u201cFeet then finish.\u201d\n\nQuick note on this morning: next time, a simple \u201cI slept badly; I\u2019ll be sharper this afternoon\u201d builds trust and buys you grace.
