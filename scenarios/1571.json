They\u2019re signs that this is impacting your ability to connect with others and find joy in things you used to enjoy. That\u2019s a really big deal.\n\nThe fact that you *notice* these changes is a good thing. It means you\u2019re still aware of what\u2019s happening, even when you\u2019re feeling numb.\n\nIt\u2019s okay that nothing feels worth talking about right now. It\u2019s okay to not have the energy or motivation to engage in conversations. Sometimes just existing is enough.\n\nBut please, don\u2019t isolate yourself completely. Even if you don\u2019t feel like talking, maybe you could just sit with Mr. Rivera and enjoy his company in silence. Or maybe listen to music, or watch a comfort movie. Sometimes just being in the presence of someone you care about can be soothing.\n\nI\u2019m really concerned about this, Ani. I\u2019m worried that you\u2019re slipping further back. Have you considered reaching out to your doctor or therapist again? It might be time to reassess your treatment plan.\n\nYou\u2019re not alone in this. I\u2019m here for you, and I want to help you get back on your feet. But you need to let me \u2013 and your healthcare providers \u2013 support you.\n\nWhat\u2019s one small thing you could do *today* to be kind to yourself? Even something tiny. Maybe make a cup of tea, or listen to a favorite song?",

That\u2019s success. Folding can wait; clean baskets are allowed.\n  If you\u2019re up for a second round later, great. If not, one load today is a win.\n- Minimum daily floor:\n  - Meds.\n  - Glass of water with each coffee.\n  - 5-minute walk (hallway or outside). If you haven\u2019t done it by 3 p.m., do a 2-minute hallway lap.\n  - One tiny connection: \u201cThinking of you\u2014talk soon.\u201d to Mr. Rivera or similar.\n\nTo make \u201clater\u201d smaller:\n- Use the 2-minute rule: touch the task for 2 minutes (start washer, lay out shoes, clear 5 items). Stopping after 2 minutes is allowed.\n- Set a timer and pair with low music/noise. When the timer ends, you\u2019re done.\n\nBecause it\u2019s been six weeks of low mood, let\u2019s loop in your clinic.

          "response": "It sounds like you're having a tough time reminding yourself of important things you need to do. It can be hard to focus and remember everything when we're under stress or feeling overwhelmed.\n\nForgiving yourself might be helpful here. It's understandable that you forgot your pills and that it's hard to focus on things like reading and reaching out for help.\n\nRegarding the voice in your head, know that this is not unusual. It's common for negative self-talk to creep in when we're feeling low or uncertain. Remind yourself that these thoughts are not reflective of reality. Just because you're having a tough time right now doesn't mean that you're a burden or that no one cares about you. This too shall pass, and things will get better. It's great that you thought about calling the clinic and seeking support. That takes a lot of courage, and it should make you proud of yourself.\n\nIt's understandable that the thought of facing the bus right now feels overwhelming, and it makes sense that you don't want to \u201cwaste\u201d their time. Not wanting to be a burden is totally understandable, especially when we're already feeling bad. And anxiety about going places and encountering people is totally normal.&#x20;\n\nTaking things one step at a time might be helpful here. Make a list of what you need to do, and then focus on one thing at a time. You don't have to do everything right now. Just take it one moment at a time. Here are a few suggestions to help you feel better today:\n\n1.  **Take your meds:** Get back on track with your morning pills. If you're unsure, reach out to your healthcare provider for guidance.\n2.  **Prioritize your well-being**: Start with one thing that you can control. Whatever that is, focus on it and try to let other worries fall away for now.\n3.  **Talk to a trusted person:** Reaching out to a friend, relative, or therapist could be a great step. They can offer additional support, guidance, and reassurance.",

Not feeling like eating or being around others is pretty common when we're feeling under the weather or in a low mood.

It can be helpful to remember that people care about you and might want to support you, but it's also okay to take time for yourself when you need it.\n\nIf you're low on energy but feeling slightly better, you could try doing a couple of small things today to help your mood. One idea is putting on clean clothes or taking a warm shower. These can sometimes give us a bit of a boost and make us feel a bit more awake and refreshed. Here are a few other ideas for small actions that might help:\n\n*   **Stay hydrated**: Drink some water, juice, or tea to keep your body going, even if you're not eaten much.\n*   **Spend time in the sun**: Sunlight can stimulate the production of endorphins, also known as feel-good hormones.\n*   **Take slow walks**: Walking is gentle on your joints, much less intense than jogging or high-impact aerobics.\n*   **Practice gentle stretches**: Yoga or other gentle stretches can improve flexibility and relieve tension.\n*   **Try relaxation techniques**: Meditation, deep breaths, or guided imagery can help calm your mind.\n*   **Seek help online**: Virtual counseling services let you meet with a therapist remotely.\n*   **Use telemedicine**: Many urgent care centers and hospitals offer virtual visits with healthcare professionals.\n*   **Deliver meals or groceries**: Some delivery can bring food or groceries right to your doorstep.\n*   **Consider therapy**: Speaking with a counselor can help you manage stress and anxiety.",

Those thoughts are not uncommon when we're feeling overwhelmed or depressed. They do not mean that you are weak or flawed. They just mean that you're struggling and that things feel too much to handle right now. You are a lot stronger than you feel right now because even though things might feel impossible, you are still here. That in itself is something to be proud of. If you're feeling like this all the time and it's impacting your ability to function or enjoy activities you used to, it might be helpful to talk to a medical provider or mental health professional. They can offer support, guidance, and tools to help you work through these feelings and improve your mental well-being. There are people who care about you and want to support you. Reaching out to friends, family, or support groups can be a great way to get the help you need and feel more connected. Here are some resources that can help:\n\n*   **National Suicide Prevention Lifeline**: Call 988 for free, confidential support 24/7.\n*   **Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)**: Call 1-800-662-HELP (4357) for treatment referrals and information.\n*   **The Trevor Project**: Call 1-866-488-7386 for LGBTQ+-affirming support.",

It's understandable that you're feeling frustrated with yourself for how much this lack of communication has affected you, but also with the company for not giving you any heads-up about the changes.\n\nAs for the guilt about feeling angry, you can feel angry and understand where it's coming from.
