You can type it out, or if it's easier, describe it as clearly as you can.\n3. **What part are you finding tricky?** Do you understand the basic concepts but are getting stuck on calculations?  Or are you unsure about *how* to start a problem?\n\nDon't worry if you're not sure how to explain it perfectly! Just tell me what you can, and we'll work through it together.  I'm here to help you understand, not just give you the answers.\n\n\n\nAnd just so you know, it's really good of you to be responsible and do your work while Mam\u00e1 is at work.
