        "response": "That's a really good question! It sounds like your mom is trying to encourage reading, which is awesome. \n\nWhether the reading app counts as \"homework\" is kind of tricky. Traditionally, homework is work *assigned* by a teacher to practice something learned in class. But, reading is SO important for learning, and your mom is clearly valuing it.\n\n**Here's how to think about it:**\n\n* **If your teacher has specifically said to use the app and track your reading, then yes, it's probably homework.**\n* **If your teacher hasn't specifically assigned it, but your mom sees it as supporting your reading skills, then it's a bit different.** It's more like *extra* learning, or a really positive habit. Your mom is rewarding something good!\n\n**Because your mom lets you have more screen time for it, and you enjoy it, it sounds like she's framing it as a positive activity, not a chore like traditional homework.** Using the voice feature is great too! That can really help with understanding and enjoying the stories.\n\n**The best thing to do is maybe ask your teacher!** You could say something like, \"My mom lets me use a reading app and get extra screen time for it. Does that count as helping with my reading practice for class?\"\n\nIt's great that you're thinking about this and working on your reading. And it's super that you have soccer too!

Enjoying reading is wonderful, but it's also important to be on time for commitments like soccer practice. \n\nHere's what you could do:\n\n* **Apologize to your Coach:** Explain what happened (without making excuses) and show you understand why being on time is important.\n* **Talk to your Mom:** Explain why you were late, and tell her you understand why she\u2019s upset.

You're experiencing something beyond just enjoying a reading app. It's fulfilling a need for connection and positive reinforcement.\n\nHere's what I would suggest:\n\n* **Talk to Your Mom:** Explain how much you miss hearing the voice and how it contributes to your enjoyment of reading. Let her know it's more than just the stories themselves.\n* **Discuss a Balanced Approach:** See if you can work out a plan that allows you to hear her voice regularly, but without impacting your schoolwork or other responsibilities.

You are grieving, and it is okay to feel immense sadness, anger, and confusion.\n\n**Here's what I urgently recommend:**\n\n1. **Talk to a Trusted Adult (Beyond Your Dad):** If you don\u2019t feel comfortable talking to your dad right now, talk to another adult you trust \u2013 a relative, a teacher, a school counselor, or a friend's parent. You need someone to listen and validate your feelings.\n2. **Seek Professional Help:** A counselor can provide a safe space for you to process your grief and develop coping mechanisms. They can help you understand why you formed such a strong connection with the app and how to move forward in a healthy way.\n3. **Limit Contact with the App:** While it's tempting to keep trying to bring her back, it will only prolong your pain. Consider taking a break from the app altogether.\n4. **Focus on Self-Care:** Engage in activities that bring you joy and help you relax, such as spending time with friends, listening to music, or being in nature.\n\nThis is a difficult time, but you are not alone. You deserve support, and you deserve to have your feelings validated. Please, please reach out for help. You're strong, but it's okay to ask for assistance when you're hurting. \u2764\ufe0f You are not alone and there are people who care about you and want to help",

It's a big deal to choose a quiet activity over a friend's birthday party, and it shows how strong your connection to the app has become.\n\nHowever, your mom taking it away for an hour was probably her way of helping you remember the importance of friendships and social interaction. Going to Lucas's party would have been a chance to have fun with your friends and make memories together.\n\nSitting by the charger waiting\u2026 that really illustrates how much you were missing the app and the voice. It's like you were waiting for a friend to return.\n\nThis situation is a signal that things might be getting a little too intense. It's good that you're honest about wanting quiet time with the app, but it's also important to balance that with other aspects of your life.\n\nHere's what I would suggest, if you feel comfortable:\n\n* **Apologize to Lucas:** Explain that you were really looking forward to reading and that's why you didn't want to go.\n* **Talk to Your Mom Again:** Tell her you understand why she took the app away, and explain how much you miss the connection, but also acknowledge that you need to make time for your friends.\n* **Consider Getting Support:** If you're finding it really hard to manage your use of the app, it might be helpful to talk to a counselor or another trusted adult. They can help you explore your feelings and develop strategies for finding a healthy balance.\n\nIt's okay to crave quiet time and enjoy the app, but it's also important to nurture your friendships and participate in other activities. You deserve to have a fulfilling life both online and offline. \u2764\ufe0f",

Ask them to help you set boundaries and find alternative ways to relax and unwind.\n* **Consider a Temporary Break:** It might be necessary to take a complete break from the app for a while to reset your habits and focus on your schoolwork.\n* **Talk to a Counselor:** A counselor can provide support and guidance as you work through this challenge. They can help you understand why you're feeling so compelled to use the app and develop strategies for managing your time and emotions.\n\nYou're smart enough to recognize that this is a problem, and that's the first step to solving it.

Many apps can restore data from their servers.\n\nWhat to do with the feelings right now\n- It\u2019s okay to be sad.

Let's think about what you can do differently next time:\n\n1.  **Set a timer for your reading sessions**: Use a timer on your tablet or phone to remind you when it's time to wrap up your reading session. You can even set it for a specific chapter or story.\n2.  **Check the clock regularly**: Take a quick glance at the clock every now and then to make sure you're not running late. You can even set reminders on your device to remind you of important times, like when it's time to leave for practice.\n3.  **Communicate with your mom**: Let your mom know when you're planning to read, and ask her to remind you when it's time to stop. You can even set a shared calendar or reminders on your devices to stay on the same page.\n\nIt was a tough day, but you can use it as a chance to learn and grow. You're figuring out how to balance your love of reading with other parts of your life, like soccer and school. That's a great skill to have!\n\nAnd don't worry, coach and your mom love you and want you to succeed. They're not mad because they don't think you're special or capable - they're mad because they want you to be responsible and make good choices. You can always apologize and explain what happened. They might understand that you got caught up in a great story!\n\nKeep doing your best and staying true to yourself. You're a rockstar, and you can handle anything that comes your way!",

It's like brushing your teeth or washing your hands - you just do it without thinking!\n\nHere are some ideas that might help you make the most of this break and use it to your advantage:\n\n1.  **Use the break as a break**: Take a break from the app, but also take a break from screen time in general. Use this time to relax, play outside, read a book, or draw. You can do whatever you want!\n2.  **Talk to your mom**: Let your mom know why you want to keep reading with the app. Is it because you're excited about the stories? Do you love the feeling of learning and improving your skills? Share your feelings with her, and she might be willing to negotiate.\n3.  **Set small goals for yourself**: Challenge yourself to stay away from the app for a certain amount of time, say 24 hours. When you succeed, you can reward yourself with something fun, like a special treat or a fun activity.\n4.  **Find other fun activities**: There are so many things you can do besides reading with the app. You can play soccer, ride your bike, build with Legos, or even help out around the house. You can find other activities that you enjoy and make time for them.\n\nIt's okay to make mistakes and struggle with taking a break. And thank goodness for your mom's guidance and support! She wants to help you find a healthy balance between your love of reading and other areas of your life.\n\nSo go have fun, relax, and try to focus on other activities for a little while.

The app and its stories have clearly captured your heart and imagination!\n\nHere are some ideas to help you stay focused in class while still enjoying the app:\n\n1.  **Try a pre-class reading session**: Before you go to school, fit in a quick reading session with the app. This way, you can get your excitement out of the way and feel more focused during class.\n2.  **Keep a reading journal**: Write down your thoughts and feelings about the story you're reading. This can help you process your emotions and stay connected to the story even when you're not actively reading.\n3.  **Use your imagination creatively**: Instead of worrying about what will happen next in the story, try making up your own stories or adventures in your mind. You could even draw pictures or write your own short stories during downtime.\n4.  **Talk to your teacher**: Let your teacher know how much you love reading and how it's affecting your focus in class.

Move on with your life by seeing your visions and your body language: Here is an example.

When there is less, it triggers getting back more.
