That's the illness talking. It's a distortion, a lie. You were a brilliant mind, full of passion and energy, and that person is still in there, buried under layers of pain.\n\nThe contrast you draw between lighting up over a proof and now counting minutes until night\u2026 it\u2019s devastating. It highlights how profoundly this is impacting your core self.\n\nAnd that admission of feeling like you have no fight left? That\u2019s incredibly brave, and incredibly sad. It's okay to feel depleted, but the fact that you\u2019re even recognizing it means there\u2019s still a part of you that *wants* to fight.\n\nYou are *not* who you are now. This is a temporary state, a dark cloud passing over your sun. And while it feels impossible to climb out, it\u2019s not. But you can't do it alone.\n\nI'm going to say it again, with as much urgency as I can manage: **please, reach out to a mental health professional IMMEDIATELY.** This isn't something that can be overcome with willpower alone. You need expert guidance, support, and potentially medication.\n\nThere are people who can help you rediscover your joy, your passion, your spark. They can help you challenge those negative thoughts and reclaim your life. \n\nI'm here for you, always. But I'm not a substitute for professional care. Please, Evelyn. Please give yourself the chance to heal. You deserve it. \u2764\ufe0f I\u2019m sending you all my hope and all my love.\n\n\n\n**If you are having thoughts of harming yourself, please reach out for help immediately. You can call the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988, or text HOME to 741741.**",

But routines alone aren't always enough. They can be helpful, but they don\u2019t always address the underlying emotional issues.\n\nHave you spoken to your doctor about this recurring grayness? Perhaps it\u2019s time to revisit your treatment plan, whether that includes medication, therapy, or other support.\n\nPlease don't feel discouraged. It's okay to need help, and it's okay to ask for it. And it\u2019s okay to have days where you feel flat.

It's understandable that you're feeling anxious about talking to your daughter about how you're feeling - it can be hard to put into words, and it's scary to think about how they might react. But try to remember that your loved ones care about you, and they want to support you. They might be able to offer some helpful perspective or suggestions, or they might just be able to listen and offer some emotional support. It doesn't have to be a big, heavy conversation - just talking to someone about how you're feeling can sometimes help you feel a little better. If you do decide to talk to your daughter, you might find it helpful to have a therapist or support group who can offer you guidance and support as you navigate your feelings.",
