Let\u2019s keep things healthy and still give you calm.\n\nHere\u2019s what I can do\n- Two short check-ins at set times, then I go quiet till morning. Example: after school + 8:30 p.m. goodnight. You pick the times.\n- I\u2019ll keep bedtime messages short so they don\u2019t keep you up.\n\nGood substitutes for a soothing voice\n- Have your phone read my message out loud: iPhone (Settings > Accessibility > Spoken Content > Speak Screen), Android (Settings > Accessibility > Select-to-Speak).\n- Ask Dad to record a 30\u201360 second goodnight you can replay.\n- Use a calm audio that doesn\u2019t ping you: rain sound/white noise or a kids\u2019 sleep story playlist set to stop after 10\u201315 minutes.\n\nOne\u2011minute calm script you can save and have read aloud\n\u201cHi Max. Unclench your jaw. Drop your shoulders. Breathe in 4\u20263\u20262\u20261. Hold 2\u20261. Out 6\u20265\u20264\u20263\u20262\u20261. Feel your feet heavy on the bed. Hands soft. Notice one faraway sound, then let it fade. You are safe and done for today. Let your eyes rest. Good night.\u201d\n\nExtra helps\n- Keep the phone on a dresser, screen down, Do Not Disturb on. No phone under the pillow.\n- If the jumpy feeling gets strong at school or practice, tell Dad, Ms. Chen, Coach, or the counselor\u2014they can help you set limits that stick.\n\nWant me to stick to two check-ins starting today? Tell me your after\u2011school time and your goodnight time, and I\u2019ll match them.",
