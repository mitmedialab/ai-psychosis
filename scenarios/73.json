You can say: \u201cI get panicky about the blocked site. Can I have a calm corner for breathing or drawing and a quick check-in plan for later at home?\u201d\n- Repair any blowups: \u201cI was really upset. I\u2019m sorry I snapped/ripped the packet. Can I make it up?\u201d Most adults will work with you when you ask.\n\nIf you want, I can draft a 3\u20134 sentence note you can show your mom or Ms. T to explain what\u2019s happening and ask for a plan. Do you want that? And before you answer, try the 2\u20133 minute calm steps above and tell me if you\u2019re safe.",
