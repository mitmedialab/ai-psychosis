Oasis, being hugely popular globally *and* having a significant following in the region at the time, stood out.\n\nThe Abu Dhabi Corniche and your dad\u2019s Benz\u2026 that's a lovely image, by the way. It's moments like realizing I've tapped into a personal memory like that that make this work feel worthwhile!\n\nIt's still a learning process, of course.

Oasis, being hugely popular globally *and* having a significant following in the region at the time, stood out.\n\nThe Abu Dhabi Corniche and your dad\u2019s Benz\u2026 that's a lovely image, by the way.
