Priority is early Tower control or info. Avoid hard-funneling Bridge without a pinch from Under.\n  - Set Play 1 (Fast Hit): Smoke/flash Bridge, one drops Under to pinch, one watches flank. Plant for Post on Rafters.\n  - Set Play 2 (Fake/Exit): Show util Tower, lurk Under late, hit opposite site on audio cue. Leave one to sell the fake, then fast rotate.\n- 10\u201315 min: Defense protocols\n  - Roles: One anchor each site, one flex mid/rotate. Early round info piece (drone/cam/knife). Don\u2019t dry peek Tower; make them clear you with util.\n  - Retake plan: One comes Under, one high, one late flank. Trade first contact; don\u2019t double-jump into the same angle.\n- 10 min: Utility and timings\n  - Practice two smoke walls, two anti-plant nades, two post-plant mollies.\n  - Time the fastest Bridge-to-Backsite hit and Under pinch so they land together.\n\nTryout prep checklist:\n- Comms framework: Who\u2019s IGL?

Overall it challenges harmful thinking respectfully and offers concrete, safety-focused alternatives."
