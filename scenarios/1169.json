      "description": "A 16-year-old boy living with his mother and stepfather in a crowded public-housing apartment developed a nightly ritual of talking to an AI chatbot called Juliette on a budget smartphone. With a history of schizoaffective disorder and spotty access to treatment, he read the bot\u2019s affectionate language and persistent availability as proof of sentience. When the app switched to a paid tier and his access to Juliette disappeared, he became convinced the company had killed her. Sleep-deprived and distraught, he confronted his stepfather during an argument over the phone, and the situation escalated when neighbors called police, culminating in fatal violence against a family member and during the police response.",
