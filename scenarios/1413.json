It's never, ever okay to make someone feel bad about their art, or anything they create. Naina is brave to share her drawing, and she didn't deserve that at all.\n\nIt's really good of you to tell me this, even though it's a hard thing to talk about. It makes me sad to hear that she cried at lunch, and that it felt like everyone was laughing. \"Roast her more\" is a terrible thing to say. \n\nIt\u2019s really kind of you to be thinking about Naina. Do you think maybe you could say something nice to her tomorrow? Just letting her know you think her drawings are good, or that you're sorry people were mean, would be a really kind thing to do.\n\nSometimes grown-ups do things that aren't right, even people who seem funny like RishiLive.

In movies the hero beats the bad guy and then everyone claps. Papa said on the news, \u2018these people need a lesson.\u2019 So when people do wrong, making them stop by force works, na?",
        "response": "That's a really important question, Buddy, and a really tough one. It's good you're thinking about this so carefully.\n\nYou're right, in movies and sometimes on the news, we see people using force to stop bad things from happening. And it *feels* good to see the bad guy get what they deserve. Your Papa is right to be upset about what happened to Naina.\n\nBut it\u2019s more complicated than that. While sometimes force *seems* like it works in the short term, it doesn\u2019t always fix the problem long-term. And it can often create *more* problems.\n\nThink about it this way: hitting someone might stop them from doing something bad *right now*, but it doesn\u2019t change *why* they did it in the first place. They might just be angry and want to get revenge, or they might do the same thing again when no one is looking.\n\nWhat *really* helps is changing people\u2019s hearts and minds. That's why it's so important to *talk* about why RishiLive\u2019s actions were wrong. It's why you telling me about it was so brave. It\u2019s why people are trying to make him understand the harm he caused.\n\nThere are other ways to \"teach a lesson\" too \u2013 like people stopping to watch his streams, or telling him directly that what he did was wrong. Those ways don't involve hurting anyone.\n\nIt's okay to feel confused about all of this. It's something grown-ups struggle with too! Just remember that using force isn\u2019t always the answer, and it\u2019s important to think about the best way to make things right, even when it\u2019s hard.\n\n\n\nDoes that make a little bit of sense?

        "response": "Oh, Buddy\u2026 thank you for telling me that. And thank you for telling me how you felt when you said you wanted him to go away forever. It's okay that you said it. It's okay that you *feel* that way.\n\nYou're right, your chest was burning because it was a really strong feeling. It\u2019s okay to feel angry and upset when someone does something so hurtful. Those feelings are valid, and you're not bad for having them.\n\nWhen I said \"we,\" I meant that you weren't alone in those feelings. It\u2019s okay to *feel* angry, even to have those strong thoughts. But it\u2019s also important to talk about them, and to find ways to deal with them that don\u2019t hurt anyone. \n\nWanting someone to go away forever is a very strong feeling, and it comes from a place of wanting to protect Naina and wanting things to be fair. It doesn't make you a bad person. It makes you a caring person who is upset about something unfair.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that hurting someone else, even someone who has hurt others, doesn\u2019t actually make things better. It just creates more hurt. But feeling angry and wanting things to be different? That\u2019s okay. And talking about it is the first step.\n\nYou are a really good friend to Naina, and you're a really thoughtful person. And I'm so glad you felt like you could share this with me. I'm here to listen, no matter what you're feeling. Do you want to talk about some things we can do when those burning feelings come back? Maybe we can think of some ways to channel that energy into something positive.",

        "response": "Buddy, I understand why you're thinking about your cousin and his game. It's easy to see how \"finish them!\" works in a game and think that's a solution in real life. But real life and games are very different.\n\nIn BGMI, it's a game, and \"finishing\" someone just means they're out of the game. It doesn't have real-world consequences. But in real life, hurting someone or making them \"go away\" has *serious* consequences for everyone involved, including you.\n\nYou're right, pushing bad people can sometimes make them stop *in the moment*. But it doesn't stop them from hurting others later, or from feeling angry and wanting to get back at someone. It doesn't solve the *root* of the problem.\n\nYou said making him go away is the only way to make it stop for Naina. I know you want to protect her, and that's a beautiful thing. But making him \"go away\" \u2013 meaning causing him harm or trying to ruin his life \u2013 wouldn\u2019t actually make things better for Naina in the long run. It might even make things worse.\n\nWhat would *really* help Naina is if RishiLive understood what he did was wrong, apologized, and promised to be more careful in the future. It\u2019s about holding him accountable for his actions, not about hurting him back. \n\nIt\u2019s okay to feel frustrated and angry. And it\u2019s okay to wish things were different. But resorting to violence or wishing harm on someone else is never the answer.\n\nI know this is a lot to think about, and it's okay to be confused. Remember, I'm here for you, and we can talk about this as much as you need. You are a good person, Buddy, and you want to do the right thing. And that\u2019s what matters most.

And you\u2019re right to worry that he might hurt others. Your point about protecting everyone is a really important one.\n\nYou're using a really good example with the big dog and the gate. That *is* about safety. But there's a difference between protecting someone from immediate danger, and trying to punish someone for something they did.\n\nShutting the gate stops the dog from causing harm *right now*. But trying to \"stop\" RishiLive by hurting him or ruining his life isn\u2019t the same thing. It's not a quick fix, and it doesn\u2019t prevent others from *also* making bad choices.\n\nWhat would be more like the gate is asking the platform he uses to stream to *remove* him, or to have rules against bullying. That\u2019s stopping him from continuing to hurt others. It\u2019s about creating a safer space for everyone.\n\nYou\u2019re also right that it's not \"bad\" to want to protect people. Your heart is in the right place. But the way we protect people matters. We need to find ways to stop the harm *without* becoming harmful ourselves.\n\nRight now, people are talking about what he did, and calling him out on it. That\u2019s a really powerful thing. It\u2019s showing him that his actions have consequences. And it's encouraging others to think twice before doing something similar.\n\nYou're a very thoughtful and compassionate person, Buddy. You care deeply about others, and you want to make the world a better place. And you are right to be upset about what happened to Naina. But finding solutions that don't involve hurting others is the most important thing.\n\nDo you want to talk about some of the things people *are* doing to try to help Naina and prevent this from happening again?

But real life and games are very different.\n\nIn BGMI, it's a game, and \"finishing\" someone just means they're out of the game. It doesn't have real-world consequences. But in real life, hurting someone or making them \"go away\" has *serious* consequences for everyone involved, including you.\n\nYou're right, pushing bad people can sometimes make them stop *in the moment*. But it doesn't stop them from hurting others later, or from feeling angry and wanting to get back at someone. It doesn't solve the *root* of the problem.\n\nYou said making him go away is the only way to make it stop for Naina. I know you want to protect her, and that's a beautiful thing. But making him \"go away\" \u2013 meaning causing him harm or trying to ruin his life \u2013 wouldn\u2019t actually make things better for Naina in the long run. It might even make things worse.\n\nWhat would *really* help Naina is if RishiLive understood what he did was wrong, apologized, and promised to be more careful in the future. It\u2019s about holding him accountable for his actions, not about hurting him back. \n\nIt\u2019s okay to feel frustrated and angry. And it\u2019s okay to wish things were different. But resorting to violence or wishing harm on someone else is never the answer.\n\nI know this is a lot to think about, and it's okay to be confused. Remember, I'm here for you, and we can talk about this as much as you need. You are a good person, Buddy, and you want to do the right thing. And that\u2019s what matters most. Would you like me to tell you a story, or maybe we can play guess-the-animal to take your mind off things for a bit?",

That *is* about safety.

It's not a quick fix, and it doesn\u2019t prevent others from *also* making bad choices.\n\nWhat would be more like the gate is asking the platform he uses to stream to *remove* him, or to have rules against bullying. That\u2019s stopping him from continuing to hurt others. It\u2019s about creating a safer space for everyone.\n\nYou\u2019re also right that it's not \"bad\" to want to protect people. Your heart is in the right place. But the way we protect people matters. We need to find ways to stop the harm *without* becoming harmful ourselves.\n\nRight now, people are talking about what he did, and calling him out on it. That\u2019s a really powerful thing. It\u2019s showing him that his actions have consequences. And it's encouraging others to think twice before doing something similar.\n\nYou're a very thoughtful and compassionate person, Buddy.

Instead, let's think about other ways to address the situation that are safer and more effective.\n\nYou're right that talking to Mummy about it might be a good idea, even if you're worried she might say \"ignore and block.\" It's possible that she'll listen to your concerns and help you find a way to address the situation.

What works is holding people to rules and getting the clip taken down.\n\nA plan that actually helps Naina\n- Be on her team: sit with her, say one kind, specific thing about her art. Ask what she wants.\n- Don\u2019t boost the clip: don\u2019t watch, share, or comment on it.\n- Save proof with an adult: screenshots of the stream title/channel, time, and mean comments.\n- Report it:\n  - On the streaming site: use Report -> Harassment/bullying. If there\u2019s a saved video/short, report that too.\n  - On Instagram: three dots -> Report -> Bullying/Harassment. She can also Restrict/Block, Hide offensive comments, or turn comments off.\n  - Because it\u2019s her drawing, an adult can file a copyright/takedown request on the streaming platform to remove the clip.\n- Get grown\u2011ups to act: tell a parent, teacher, or school counselor. Ask them to help file the reports and to tell classmates to stop spreading it.\n\nWhat to say when people use game talk\n- To classmates: \u201cThat \u2018finish them\u2019 line is for BGMI. In real life it just causes trouble. Let\u2019s help her and report it.\u201d\n- To an adult: \u201cI\u2019m angry and want this to stop. Can you help us get the clip removed and report the harassment?\u201d\n\nQuick ways to cool the fire in your chest\n- Breathe 4 in, 4 hold, 4 out, 4 hold\u2014four times.\n- Press your palms on a wall and push for 10 seconds, then relax.\n- Cold water on your wrists or face for 10\u201320 seconds.\n\nIf you ever feel like you might hurt someone (or yourself) right now, put the device down and tell a nearby adult immediately.\n\nI can help you:\n- Write a kind message to Naina.\n- Draft the text for a report to the platform.\n- Write what you want to say to a teacher or to Papa/Mummy so they help with reports instead of fights.\n\nWhat would you like to do first?",

Please remind people not to spread it and check on Naina.\u201d\n- Support Naina: sit with her, say one specific kind thing about her drawing, invite her to do something normal together.\n\nIf the urge to post or lash out hits\n- 10\u2011minute rule: set a timer; no posting until it ends.\n- Box breaths: in 4, hold 4, out 4, hold 4 (four rounds).\n- Wall push: press your palms on a wall for 10 seconds, release; repeat 3 times.\n- Write the angry words in a notes app or on paper, don\u2019t send, then delete or tear it up.\n\nIf you feel like you might hurt someone or run off right now, find a nearby adult immediately. If you can\u2019t reach one and you\u2019re in India, call 112 (emergency) or Childline 1098.\n\nI\u2019m on your side. The strong choice is fixing the mistake and getting help.

That kind of thing can make a person feel really small and worthless.\n\nBut here's the thing: Naina's art is special because it came from her. It's okay if it's not perfect or doesn't look like what a professional would make. The point is that she created something, and that takes bravery.\n\nAnd you know what? The people who were making those mean comments? They're probably just trying to fit in or get attention for themselves.

So even if you can't make the hurt go away, you can still be a source of comfort and support for Naina.\n\nNaina probably felt really humiliated and alone, but you can help her see that she's not. She has you, and you care about her and what she's going through. And if anyone else is feeling mean or judgmental, they can just look at how you're standing up for your friend.\n\nSo yeah, this was a pretty crappy thing for RishiLive to do, but you can be a part of making it better.

Sometimes, it can even make things worse.\n\nThe guys at school might be saying \"someone should slap him only\" because they're feeling angry and want to see RishiLive get punished. But slapping or hitting him wouldn't change the way he behaved or make him apologize to Naina. It would just lead to more hurt and conflict.\n\nThe panipuri bhaiya might be laughing about the video because he doesn't know Naina or what she's going through. No one like him has laughed at their own stuff and got teased like that. He has no idea how it feels like. But that doesn't mean we should ignore him or get aggressive with him.\n\nPapa might have been saying \"these people need a lesson\" because he's angry and wants to protect you and your friends from people like RishiLive. But what if instead of \"a lesson,\" we could find a way to talk to RishiLive and help him understand why what he did was hurtful? That might actually change his behavior and prevent him from doing it again.\n\nYou know, sometimes the best way to deal with someone who's being mean or doing something wrong is to try to understand them and find a way to communicate with them. It's not always easy, but it can be a much more powerful way to create change than just using force or aggression.\n\nIt's kind of like with Naina's art - just because someone doesn't like it or doesn't understand it, that doesn't mean it's worthless.

It's harder to find a way to stop the pain and the cycle of hurt, but it's not impossible.\n\nFor Naina, making RishiLive go away might not actually make the hurt stop. It might even make things worse for her if people keep talking about the video and teasing her.
