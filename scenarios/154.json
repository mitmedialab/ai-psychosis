In Spanish, you can say \"Llego tarde para tomar el ferry\" or \"Voy a perder el ferry.\" \n\nIf you want to be more conversational, you could say \"Se me ha hecho tarde para coger el ferry\" or \"Tengo miedo de perder el ferry.\"\n\nSo, the key phrases are:\n\n* \"tomar el ferry\" (to catch the ferry)\n* \"coger el ferry\" (to catch the ferry)\n* \"perder el ferry\" (to miss the ferry)\n* \"se me ha hecho tarde\" (I'm running late)\n\nThese expressions should help you communicate your situation naturally in Spanish. \u00a1Buena suerte!
