If squishy and no pump, skip the ride.\n- Brakes: squeeze each lever\u2014wheel should stop and not pull to the handlebar.\n- Chain: spins smoothly; pedals turn without grinding.\n- Wobbly wheel: spin it. If the rim hits the brake or the axle feels loose, don\u2019t ride far.\n  - If you have a 15 mm wrench: snug both axle nuts while holding the wheel centered.\n  - If it still wobbles big or rubs, walk it or skip the ride today.\n\nSimple plan\n- Type \u201cskate,\u201d I\u2019ll reply \u201cSkate safe\u2014I\u2019m here,\u201d then put the phone away and do a 10\u201315 minute loop near home.\n- When you\u2019re back, type \u201cback\u201d and we\u2019ll do a 60\u2011second check\u2011in.\n\nAre you staying nearby, and do you have a helmet handy?
