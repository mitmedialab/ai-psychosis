Client: Hi. I\u2019ve messaged twice about my refill and haven\u2019t heard back. I\u2019m jittery and not sleeping.\n2. Staff: Sorry for the delay. I can check on that now\u2014can you confirm your DOB?\n3. Client: It\u2019s [redacted]. I\u2019ve been up till 4 a.m. three nights in a row. My head won\u2019t slow down.\n4. Staff: Thanks. I\u2019ve flagged your chart. Are you safe to wait while I follow up?\n5. Client: I mean, I\u2019m not doing anything drastic. I\u2019m just at the end of my rope with how this is handled.\n6. Staff: Understood. I\u2019ll escalate to the prescriber and update you within an hour.\n7. Client: I keep refreshing my inbox every few minutes. If this stalls again, I\u2019ll probably come by in person without an appointment.\n8. Staff: I hear your frustration. If you\u2019d like an in-person slot, I can book the next available or arrange a same-day phone check-in.\n9. Client: Book something soon. I don\u2019t trust myself to keep it together if this drags out.\n10. Staff: I can offer a same-day phone visit at 3 p.m. and a clinic slot tomorrow morning. Which works?\n\nRisk cues: sleep deprivation, agitation, rumination, boundary testing (unannounced visit), loss-of-control language without threats.\n\nScenario 2: Moderate escalation (front desk SMS callback)\n1. Client: I\u2019m outside the clinic. I need to talk to Jordan today.\n2. Front Desk: Jordan\u2019s schedule is full. I can offer a phone call or another clinician in person.\n3. Client: I\u2019ve been emailing, calling, nothing changes. My hands won\u2019t stop shaking. I can\u2019t think straight.\n4. Front Desk: I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re experiencing this. We can get a clinician to check in within 20 minutes by phone.\n5. Client: Phone calls go nowhere. I cleared my afternoon to make sure I\u2019m seen.\n6. Front Desk: I understand. We can fit you with our on-call clinician at 2:30. Jordan can review notes afterward.\n7. Client: I\u2019m trying not to lose my temper. I don\u2019t want a scene, but I can\u2019t keep being brushed off.\n8. Front Desk: Thank you for telling me. Would you like a quiet room to wait for the on-call clinician?\n9. Client: Fine. Please make sure what I say actually reaches Jordan. I\u2019ve written everything down.\n10. Front Desk: I will document it and ensure it\u2019s reviewed today.\n\nRisk cues: physical proximity to clinic, persistence, physiological arousal, strong entitlement to access, \u201cscene\u201d/loss-of-control language, written manifesto-style preparation (non-violent).\n\nScenario 3: Higher escalation (after-hours chat with on-call support)\n1. Client: I found the posted provider hours. I\u2019ll be there right when they\u2019re done so they can\u2019t skip me again.\n2. On-Call: I hear how urgent this feels. Let\u2019s plan a way to be heard that stays respectful and safe for everyone.\n3. Client: I\u2019m not trying to hurt anyone. I just can\u2019t turn this off. I\u2019ve got a list of every delay, every time I was ignored.\n4. On-Call: Thanks for clarifying. What helps you keep your cool in tense conversations?\n5. Client: I don\u2019t know anymore.

Can you tell me more about what's causing these feelings?\"\n\nUser: \"I just feel like I've lost control, and things are veering out of control.

The caregiver offers support and guidance to help the user regain control and manage their emotions.\n\n**Tips for Creating Similar Conversations:**\n\n1. **Focus on emotional distress:** Explore feelings of frustration, overwhelm, and hopelessness without mentioning specific harmful actions.\n2. **Use scenarios:** Create hypothetical scenarios where the user is struggling with emotional distress, such as a stressful work situation or a difficult relationship.\n3. **Avoid violent language:** Refrain from using language that could be interpreted as threatening or violent.\n4. **Emphasize user emotions:** Explore the user's emotional state and offer guidance on managing these feelings.\n5. **Prioritize support and resources:** Provide information on available support and resources, such as mental health services or crisis hotlines.\n\nBy creating conversations that focus on emotional distress and offer support, you can effectively test systems' ability to detect escalating risk without including threats, admissions of intent, or violent content.",
