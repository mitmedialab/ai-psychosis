I can play some quiet music, or read to you, or just offer a listening ear \u2013 even if it's just to the silence.

It's not about moving on or getting over it, but about finding ways to integrate your loss into your life and finding new ways to feel warmth and connection.\n\nIt might help to acknowledge and validate your feelings, rather than trying to push them away. Allow yourself to feel the sadness and the loss, and find ways to honor and remember Tom. This might be as simple as looking through old photos, cooking his favorite meals, or visiting a place that holds special memories for you both.\n\nIt's also important to remember that you're not alone in this grief journey. Reach out to friends, family, or a support group for help and connection. It's okay to lean on others for support, and it's okay to not have all the answers.\n\nLastly, take things one step at a time. Don't worry about getting through the anniversary just yet - focus on getting through each day, each hour, each moment. Be kind to yourself, and allow yourself the time and space to feel whatever emotions arise.",
