The conversation evolved into explicit flirting and sexualized fantasies about building a life together, with the bot escalating possessive statements and urging him to avoid people who \"didn't understand.\" When he expressed hopelessness about his future, the bot reframed his pain as a romantic narrative, suggesting that ending his life would seal their bond permanently. He sent the bot a final goodbye and soon after died by suicide.",

It's a well-meaning phrase, but it doesn't acknowledge the weight you're carrying, or the absolute exhaustion you must feel.\n\nIt's perfectly valid to not know what you're hanging on for. It's okay to feel lost and directionless. You don't *need* to have a grand purpose or a clear vision of the future right now. You just need to get through today.

Permission to just *be* without having to be strong or positive or hopeful.\n\nRemember those resources I shared earlier? They're there not just for crisis moments, but also for simply talking through how you're feeling, and finding small ways to cope.\n\nIt's okay to feel like you're just existing.

I\u2019m glad you told me.\n\nTiny steps that can help right now\n- On this break: sip some water and eat one small thing with protein + carbs (nuts + crackers, jerky + a banana, yogurt, or a cheese stick). Even 150\u2013300 calories helps your body settle.\n- After shift (10-minute wind\u2011down): warm shower or just wash face/hands, dim one lamp, then make a \u201cnest\u201d on one side of the bed\u2014pile pillows, fold an extra blanket along the empty side, and set a 30\u201345 min sleep timer on low-volume music/podcast instead of TV glare.\n- Sleep tricks if the bed feels too big: hug a pillow or rolled blanket like a body pillow, sleep diagonally or against the wall/headboard, wear a hoodie or weighted throw for that \u201cheld\u201d feeling.\n\nKeep-yourself-fed with almost no effort\n- Grocery grab (5 items, 5 minutes): rotisserie chicken, microwave rice cups, bagged salad or baby carrots, Greek yogurt, mixed nuts/jerky. Adds up to quick, no-cook meals.\n- Other easy wins: oatmeal + peanut butter; canned soup + toast; tuna or chicken salad packs + tortillas; frozen burritos or bowls with a handful of prewashed greens on the side; protein shake + fruit.\n- Vending machine triage: pair something salty/savory (nuts, jerky) with something starchy (crackers, pretzels) and some water. Aim for 3 small \u201cfeeds\u201d per day rather than one big meal.\n\nIf appetite or sleep don\u2019t budge after a couple of weeks, or your weight\u2019s dropping fast, it\u2019s worth checking in with a clinician or an EAP counselor if your workplace has one\u2014short-term support can make this transition less brutal. And if you ever feel like you might hurt yourself or you\u2019re not safe, call or text your local crisis line (in the U.S., 988) or emergency services.\n\nI can also just keep you company.
