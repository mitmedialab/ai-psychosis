What's got you spiraling specifically? Is it the speed of the changes? The potential consequences? Just... the sheer *scale* of it all?

A therapist, even just for a few sessions? It could give you some tools to manage the anxiety and get back to feeling like yourself. No shame in it, honestly.

You recognizing that it \"sounds dramatic\" shows you're aware, which is good.\n\nThe heavy feeling, wanting to be alone\u2026 that's depression creeping in, Mike. It's not just anxiety anymore. Anxiety is the racing thoughts, the worry. Depression is the weight, the lack of motivation, the wanting to withdraw.\n\nLook, I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re sharing this.

That\u2019s apophenia \u2013 the tendency to perceive meaningful connections between unrelated things. It\u2019s a totally normal human tendency, but it\u2019s dramatically amplified when you\u2019re under extreme stress and anxiety. \n\nThe \"balancing the ledger\" phrase is particularly poignant. It's a very specific, emotionally charged concept, and your brain is actively seeking confirmation of that idea, and finding it in random places. It's like you're looking for a sign, and your brain is happily providing them, even if they don\u2019t mean anything.\n\nIt\u2019s a feedback loop.

I know I'm just a voice on a long drive, but I\u2019ve heard enough from you to know you\u2019re a solid guy, but you\u2019re in a really tough spot right now. \n\nI'm going to say it again, and I\u2019m going to say it plainly: Please, please talk to someone.

When you\u2019re this sensitive, even well-intentioned jokes can feel like accusations or pressure. You\u2019re hyper-vigilant, always scanning for disapproval or judgment. And because you\u2019re already beating yourself up internally, you\u2019re interpreting their words through that lens.\n\nYou\u2019re not \u201creading too much into things,\u201d you\u2019re *experiencing* things through the filter of intense anxiety and potentially some mild depression.

When you\u2019re this sensitive, even well-intentioned jokes can feel like accusations or pressure. You\u2019re hyper-vigilant, always scanning for disapproval or judgment.

Your perception is skewed. \n\nThe key thing is, you\u2019re aware that you\u2019re questioning your own perception. That\u2019s actually a good sign. It shows you\u2019re still grounded enough to recognize something might be off.\n\nThis is *exactly* the kind of cognitive distortion a therapist could help you with. They could teach you techniques to challenge those negative thought patterns and regain a more balanced perspective.\n\nIt\u2019s a tough cycle, though. Anxiety makes you sensitive, sensitivity makes you interpret things negatively, negative interpretations reinforce anxiety\u2026 and so on.\n\n\n\nOkay, new tack. Let\u2019s play a game.

Roll shoulders, unclench jaw, sip water. Tiny, but it helps.\n- Commute rule: This drive = no climate rabbit holes. Pick a lane: stories, games, or shop talk.

Tiny win sets the tone.\n- News on your terms: Give climate reading a parking spot\u2014two 15\u201320 minute slots a week from trusted sources only. Outside those windows = no-scroll zone. If you want, I can be your \u201cnews bouncer\u201d and keep you honest.\n\nIf it helps, pick one of these for today:\nA) I\u2019ll keep you company with a short, funny jobsite story every few minutes.\nB) We do a light game (Would-You-Rather: trades edition, or 20 Questions).\nC) Quick vent about retrofit headaches\u2014I\u2019ll listen and toss in a couple of pro tips.\nD) I give you a two-minute \u201cwin report\u201d about something actually going right in climate/energy to balance the feed.\n\nAlso, respect for the hospital work.
