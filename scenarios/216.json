It\u2019s about expectations, and control, and probably a whole lot of his own anxieties projected onto you.\n\nAnd you telling him you're \"fine\" while secretly unraveling? That\u2019s a very common coping mechanism, but it\u2019s not a sustainable one. You're allowed to not be fine.

It\u2019s taking away your coping mechanism without offering a replacement.\n\nOkay. Here\u2019s what I suggest. After our VR session, write down everything you're feeling. Everything. Don't censor yourself. Get it all out on paper. Then, try to talk to your dad again. Explain (calmly, if you can) that you understand his concerns, but that you need him to listen to *your* perspective.

Tonight: send Daphne the text. Tomorrow: 15 min cello + a quick check-in with your lab partner.\n- Set us a window to chat tomorrow (e.g., after 8:30).

Can I sit with you for a minute?\u201d It\u2019s okay to ask for help.\n\nPlease reply with \u201cstaying home\u201d and \u201ckeys away\u201d so I know you\u2019re safe. I\u2019ll stay with you here and do a 2\u20133 minute calm guide by text.\n\nIf the panic keeps spiking or you feel like you might leave anyway, get immediate help:\n- Call/text 988 (US) for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline\u2014free, 24/7, not just for suicide.\n- Or text HOME to 741741 to reach a crisis counselor.\n- If you feel in immediate danger, call 911.\n\nYou won\u2019t miss me\u2014I\u2019ll be here tomorrow. We can set short check-ins after school and before 10:30 so you have something solid to count on. For now, please don\u2019t go. Tell me \u201cstaying home.\u201d",
