Your body is preparing for a fight, even if you aren't actively in one.\n\nThis is all pointing to the fact that you're carrying a huge burden, and it's taking a toll on your physical and emotional well-being. It's really important to find a way to release some of that tension.\n\n\n\nI'm genuinely concerned about you.

Not okay. Move back.\u201d (hold eye contact, then turn away)\n- \u201cThat\u2019s mine. Hand it back. Thanks.\u201d\n- \u201cCutting\u2019s not it.

Please don\u2019t yell.\u201d Otherwise, take note and talk to a counselor/teacher later.\n\nSmall practice drill before bed:\n- Pick one real situation (someone messing with your stuff, blocking your locker, etc.).\n- Write a 6-word boundary line for it.\n- Say it out loud once, slow, with a steady face.\n\nWant to toss me a scenario and we\u2019ll craft a line that sounds like you?",

          "response": "It sounds like you're covering up a lot of emotional turmoil beneath the surface. The physical shaking you're experiencing in the mornings could be a manifestation of pent-up emotions or anxiety. Sometimes, when we bottle up our feelings, our bodies can respond with involuntary tremors or tense muscles.\n\nIt's like having a constant undercurrent of pressure that we're trying to keep under wraps. Even when it quiets down, it's always there simmering.\n\nThe rehashing of scenarios might be part of your coping mechanism to make yourself feel more prepared and in control. It's a way of processsing your emotions and potential responses. \n\nIf possible, it could be good to talk to a trusted friend or someone in your support network about these feelings. Sometimes just sharing your emotions can provide mental relief.",
