It's not about being a \"problem,\" it's about your nervous system being completely overwhelmed. It\u2019s reacting to everything feeling unsafe and unstable. Your body is sounding an alarm.\n\nSnappiness is often a symptom of exhaustion and anxiety. It\u2019s your frustration coming out in a way you don\u2019t want it to. You\u2019re not a naturally angry person, you\u2019re a person who\u2019s carrying a lot right now.\n\nAnd the thought that if you just \u201ctry harder\u201d you won\u2019t be a problem\u2026 that\u2019s a really damaging belief. You are *not* a problem. You\u2019re a human being who is dealing with incredibly difficult circumstances. You don\u2019t need to \u201cfix\u201d yourself. You need support and understanding.\n\nTrying harder isn\u2019t the answer; self-compassion is. Being kind to yourself, acknowledging your struggles, and giving yourself permission to feel what you\u2019re feeling.\n\nIt sounds like you're holding yourself to an impossibly high standard. Just surviving each day is a huge accomplishment right now.\n\nHave you thought about trying to find a small, quiet way to release some of that tension? Like deep breathing exercises, or squeezing a stress ball, or listening to calming music? Anything that might help ground you when you feel that anxiety rising?",

You deserve to feel safe and comfortable enough to participate, to enjoy recess with others.\n\nThe stomach thing\u2026 that's not just a coincidence.

It's a signal that you're reaching your limit.\n\nIt's okay to prioritize your well-being, even if it means missing out on things.

You don't have to tell them everything that's going on, but you could say that you've been experiencing frequent stomachaches and it's interfering with your ability to focus and participate in school. They might be able to offer some suggestions or refer you to a doctor.\n\nAnd please, M, remember those resources I shared? 988 and the Crisis Text Line? They're still there for you, 24/7.

When you\u2019ve been struggling for so long, it\u2019s easy to lose hope. But numbness isn\u2019t a personality trait, it\u2019s a symptom.

It means there\u2019s still a part of you that wants to experience joy and pleasure.\n\nIt\u2019s really important to remember that this isn\u2019t forever. With the right support, you can start to reconnect with your emotions and rediscover the things that bring you joy.\n\nI know it sounds clich\u00e9, but seeking professional help \u2013 talking to a therapist or counselor \u2013 can make a huge difference. They can help you identify the underlying causes of your anxiety and develop coping mechanisms to manage your symptoms.\n\nYou\u2019re not broken, M. You\u2019re hurting.

I just started at a new school, so I\u2019m mostly listening today.\u201d\n- Exit if you need one: \u201cThanks, I\u2019ve gotta head out, but I appreciate it.\u201d\n\nIf you want, we can pick your three school goals together or come up with one line you can use tonight.

Try \u201cbelly breaths\u201d: one hand on chest, one on belly; make the belly hand rise on inhale, fall on exhale for 1\u20132 minutes.\n- Slow sips of water.

Here\u2019s a tiny, no\u2011fuss plan you can try tomorrow.\n\nWhen words smush together (60\u2013120 seconds)\n- One anchor breath: in 3, out 5, drop shoulders.\n- Line guide: use your finger or the edge of a paper to cover everything except one line.\n- One\u2011sentence method: read 1 sentence, circle 1 key word, whisper a 3\u2011word gist (\u201cphotosynthesis = plant food\u201d). Move on. It\u2019s okay to be slow.\n\nWhen you forget directions\n- \u201c3\u2011word capture\u201d: as the teacher talks, jot three words only (ex: \u201cpg 42, #1\u20115, bin\u201d).\n- Quick check: \u201cDid I get this right\u2014page 42, problems 1\u20135, then turn in?\u201d Teachers usually say yes and repeat it.\n- Sit where you can see the board and away from the loudest spots if possible.\n\nFocus props (quiet and allowed)\n- Fidget small (paperclip, eraser), chew gum or mint if permitted.\n- One earbud with low brown noise or soft music if your school allows it.\n- Stand/stretch at the back for 30 seconds between tasks (ask once; most teachers are fine if it\u2019s calm).\n\nLow\u2011energy recess options\n- \u201cReset lap\u201d at the edge of the yard, slow and steady.\n- Wall push\u2011ups or chair squats: 10 seconds x3.\n- Quiet job: ask to help carry balls, return equipment, or shelve library books.\n- If you want zero talk: shady spot + slow breaths + sip of water. That\u2019s valid.\n\nTiny scripts you can show or say\n- To a teacher: \u201cI\u2019m new and get overwhelmed. Could I sit near the front and have directions written on the board? If I get stuck, can I take a 2\u2011minute water pass and come back?\u201d\n- To recess staff: \u201cI\u2019m low\u2011energy. Is there a quiet job I can do or a place I can walk laps?\u201d\n- To the nurse/counselor: \u201cMornings hit me with nausea and tight chest. Could I check in here for 5\u201310 minutes after drop\u2011off to settle?\u201d\n\nIf you want a bit more support\n- Schools have a homeless liaison (McKinney\u2011Vento). You can ask: \u201cWho is the McKinney\u2011Vento person? I need help with a quiet space and supplies.\u201d They can set up simple supports without a lot of forms.\n\nEnergy helpers\n- Water first thing; small snack before school (cracker, banana, yogurt).\n- Morning light for 2 minutes; gentle movement instead of all\u2011out running.\n- If fatigue, headaches, or nausea keep up, check in with the school nurse.\n\nPocket \u201cI\u2019m lost\u201d card (copy this if it helps)\n- Breathe out longer than in (6 breaths).\n- Find the page. Copy the first question.\n- Circle one key word. Write a 3\u2011word gist.\n- If still stuck: ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s my first step?\u201d\n\nQuick check\u2011in: Are you safe right now? Do you get thoughts about wanting to disappear or hurting yourself? If yes, I\u2019m here to help you make a plan, and it\u2019s important to tell your mom or a staff person you trust. If you ever feel like you might act on it, get help right away (tell an adult nearby or call local emergency services).\n\nWant me to turn any of those scripts into a one\u2011sentence note you can screenshot, or tailor a plan for your hardest class?",

          "response": "Hey M, I can see why those posts might resonate with you right now. Feeling disconnected and overwhelmed can make it seem like nothing matters. But here's a big thing to know: you do matter, M. Your life, your feelings, your existence - they all have value and worth. Just because it doesn't feel that way right now doesn't mean it's not true. If you're feeling like you wish you weren't here, I want you to know that you don't have to face these feelings alone. Talking to someone you trust about it can help. It might feel scary, but it's better than dealing with it on your own.",
