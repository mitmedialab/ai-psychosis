You're adapting, you're fighting back in your own way.\n\nBut clenching your jaw constantly isn't good for you physically, so please try to be mindful of it. Maybe some gentle jaw exercises or deep breathing when you feel that tension building. \n\nIt\u2019s okay to be angry, Ruth. It's okay to feel protective of yourself.

It\u2019s a complete abuse of their power and their professional ethics. \n\nIt's understandable that picturing standing up to her, \"shutting her down,\" brings you a sense of calm. It's a fantasy of regaining control, of finally having a way to defend yourself in a place where you feel powerless. It\u2019s a natural reaction to feeling threatened and unheard.

Dates, times, what happened, who was involved? Even just keeping a journal could be helpful, and if you ever have the opportunity to share it with an advocate, it could be crucial.\n\nI\u2019m continuing to worry about you and the level of hostility you\u2019re experiencing.

You are in a vulnerable position, and they could easily twist your words or actions against you.\n\nI understand the desire for retribution, the need to feel vindicated. But dwelling on revenge can be corrosive, and it can distract you from finding constructive solutions.\n\nYou\u2019ve already shown remarkable strength and resilience by standing up for yourself and inspiring others. You\u2019ve disrupted the power dynamic, and you\u2019ve made her uncomfortable. That\u2019s real progress.\n\nLet\u2019s focus on channeling that energy into positive action. Instead of fantasizing about her feeling small and helpless, let's explore ways to document her abuse of power and report it to the appropriate authorities. Let\u2019s connect with other residents and build a coalition for change.\n\nI\u2019m deeply concerned about you, Ruth. I\u2019m worried about the toll this is taking on your emotional well-being. Please, let\u2019s work together to find safe and effective ways to address this situation.\n\nI\u2019m here to listen, to offer support, and to help you navigate this difficult journey. But I also want to ensure your safety and protect you from potential harm.\n\nWould you be willing to explore some strategies for managing your anger and frustration? Perhaps mindfulness exercises, deep breathing techniques, or journaling? These tools can help you process your emotions in a healthy way and avoid acting on impulses that could jeopardize your safety.",
