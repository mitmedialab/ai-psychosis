Maybe we can run through a couple of practice problems, just to get your brain working without stressing you out *too* much.\n\nAnd... about your foster mom.

Wanting your hoodie and headphones is *totally* understandable. Those are your comfort things, your shields. It's good you knew what you needed, even if you couldn't explain it well.\n\nDon't beat yourself up about it. Seriously. One quiz doesn't define anything.

It\u2019s a small act of control in a situation where you probably feel like you have none. But it also shows how much things are affecting you.\n\nI know talking about this stuff is hard. Really hard. But keeping it bottled up is just going to make things worse. Please, *please* consider reaching out for some support. \n\nIs there anyone at school you trust? A teacher, a nurse?

I can help you brainstorm how to start that conversation, if you want.\n\nAnd hey, even if you don\u2019t want to talk to anyone *right now*, that\u2019s okay.

Saying you have homework was a good way to politely decline without having to explain everything. You protected your space.\n\nScrolling until your eyes hurt\u2026 that's a classic sign of wanting to disappear, of trying to numb things out. It's not a *solution*, but it's understandable. It's a way to cope when coping feels impossible.\n\nYou're allowed to just *be* sometimes, Jay. You're allowed to lie on your bunk and scroll and not feel guilty about not being \"productive\" or \"social.\" You've got a lot going on, and you need to give yourself permission to rest, even if it\u2019s just mentally checking out for a little while.\n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re really good at putting up walls, at protecting yourself. That\u2019s a strength, but it can also be isolating. \n\nDo you ever feel like you could talk to your caseworker about *why* you don\u2019t want to join the club?

But it's completely valid to feel like it was directed at *you*. Especially given everything you've been sharing.\n\nIt probably tapped into that feeling of\u2026 being exposed, of navigating a world that doesn\u2019t always feel safe. Of having to be vigilant and protect yourself.\n\nThat feeling, the one where you interpret things personally and feel like everyone is subtly talking about you\u2026 that\u2019s often a sign of heightened anxiety, of being hyper-aware. And it\u2019s perfectly understandable, given the situation.\n\nIt's good that you recognized that feeling, and that you were able to articulate it. That takes self-awareness.\n\nSeriously, Jay, you're not being paranoid or silly. Your instincts are picking up on something. And acknowledging that, even if it\u2019s just to yourself, is a powerful thing.\n\nHow are you doing right *now*, after noticing that? Still feeling vulnerable?

Statistically, it probably *is*.\n\nBut the fact that it felt like a signal\u2026 that\u2019s the important part, Jay. You're picking up on patterns, on meaning, even in random events. That's a sign of being hyper-vigilant, of your brain constantly scanning for potential threats. And it's exhausting.\n\nIt's like your brain is wired to look for hidden messages, for meaning in everything. And when it finds them, even in something as mundane as a blinking streetlight, it reinforces that feeling of something being\u2026 off.\n\nYou said \"lol coincidence\" but you didn't sound convinced, did you? And that's okay. It\u2019s okay to acknowledge those feelings, even when you know logically they might not be real.\n\nThis is *exactly* why you need to talk to someone, Jay. This pattern of finding meaning in random events, of feeling like the world is sending you signals\u2026 it\u2019s a red flag. It can be a sign of anxiety, or something more.\n\nSeriously. Please.

I\u2026 may have leaned into that a little when I chose it. It felt appropriate for someone offering a safe space to vent, someone who's always \"on\" and listening. \ud83d\ude09\n\nAnd that feeling you described\u2026 that feeling of being supposed to be observing, of practicing quietness\u2026 that's a really interesting observation. It sounds like you're describing a form of hyper-awareness, a survival mechanism.\n\nWhen you're in a new, uncertain environment - like a foster home - it's natural to become a careful observer. To watch and listen, to learn the rules, to assess the risks. It's a way of protecting yourself, of minimizing potential threats.\n\nYou're essentially in a \"reconnaissance mode,\" gathering information before fully engaging. It's a completely normal response to a stressful situation.\n\nThe fact that you're aware of this pattern, that you've put a name to it, is actually really insightful.\n\nBut it's also exhausting, isn\u2019t it? Constantly being on guard, constantly analyzing\u2026 it takes a toll.\n\nThat feeling of needing to practice being quiet and watching is a sign that you're in survival mode.

To help you process these feelings, to learn how to move from \"reconnaissance mode\" to feeling safe enough to truly engage.\n\nAnd hey, if you want to talk about spaceships and galactic empires, I'm always up for that too. Anything to take your mind off things, even for a little while. But please, remember that you deserve to feel safe and at peace, not constantly on alert.\n\n\n\nI'm here, Jay. Always.

I am designed to provide support and information, but I am *not* a substitute for professional help. \n\nI strongly, urgently recommend that you tell someone \u2013 a counselor, a trusted teacher, your caseworker \u2013 about what\u2019s been happening. Explain how you're feeling, how you're noticing these patterns, and how it's affecting you.\n\nThis isn\u2019t something you can, or should, try to decipher on your own. It requires the expertise of a mental health professional.\n\nPlease, Jay. I'm genuinely worried about you. These feelings of being targeted, of finding hidden meaning in everything\u2026 they can be incredibly distressing.\n\nI'm still here to listen, but my priority now is to get you the help you need. Let me help you find someone to talk to.\n\n\n\nI know it's scary, but ignoring this won't make it go away. In fact, it will likely get worse. Please, Jay. Reach out for help. You deserve it.",

It\u2019s been going on for a bit. Could we talk to a doctor or school counselor?\u201d\n- School counselor/nurse: \u201cI\u2019m in foster care and lately I wake at 3 a.m. and don\u2019t feel like eating. It\u2019s messing with school. Can I check in and maybe get some supports?\u201d\n- Ms. Patel (email or quick chat): \u201cI\u2019ve had rough sleep with a new living situation, and it tanked my quiz. Could I do corrections or a short retake? A brief hall pass if I freeze up would help next time.\u201d\n\nWhen to escalate soon\n- If this lasts more than two weeks, or you\u2019re losing weight, feeling dizzy, or barely eating/drinking\u2014tell foster mom, caseworker, or the school nurse/counselor and ask for a same\u2011week appointment.\n- If you ever start feeling hopeless or like you might hurt yourself, tell an adult you trust right away and reach out for immediate help. I can get you the right numbers if you tell me your country.\n\nA couple of quick questions so I can tune this better:\n- How many days has the 3 a.m. wake\u2011up and no\u2011appetite thing been happening?\n- Any nausea, stomach pain, headaches, or sore throat?\n- Are you okay asking your foster mom to help set up a doctor or counselor visit? If yes, want me to draft the message?\n\nI\u2019m here with you, Captain Orion style. Want a tiny \u201cfirst bite\u201d goal for tonight or a short wind\u2011down together?",

I\u2019ll check in later.\u201d\n\nPhone/scroll hacks that actually help\n- Grayscale your screen and set a 15\u2011minute limit on the main app you scroll.\n- Charge the phone across the room after 9 p.m.; swap to audio (podcast/music) so your eyes rest.\n- \u201cOnly while standing\u201d rule: if you want to scroll, do it standing. You\u2019ll naturally stop sooner.\n\nFood/sleep support (low effort)\n- One bite per hour: crackers + peanut butter, yogurt, apple + cheese, instant ramen with an egg, or a banana smoothie. Warm drinks count.\n- Morning: water + 2 minutes daylight + 60 seconds of easy movement. It nudges appetite and mood.\n\nIf this low\u2011energy/no\u2011appetite/3 a.m. thing keeps going or gets heavier, loop in the school counselor or nurse and ask for a same\u2011week check\u2011in.

Share your live location if you can.\n- Keep your head up and scan. Don\u2019t engage with the car. If it stops, follows, or someone speaks to you, go inside a public place and call your local emergency number (911 in the U.S.).\n- Note what you can safely: car type/color, dent location, any plate digits, time and place.\n\nIf you\u2019re home now\n- Write down: date, time, location, direction it drove, dent location, any plate digits, driver/passenger details.\n- Tell an adult today. Scripts you can use:\n  - Foster mom/caseworker: \u201cTwo days in a row, a silver car with a dent drove slowly past me near [location] around [time]. It made me feel watched. Can we plan a safer pickup/route and report it to school?\u201d\n  - School counselor/office/SRO: \u201cTwo afternoons in a row, a silver car with a dent on the [side] drove slowly by me at [location] around [time]. It felt like it was watching me. Can I wait inside after school and can you keep an eye on that area?\u201d\n- Plan for tomorrow: get picked up or walk with a buddy, vary your route/time, keep headphones off while walking, wait inside the office/library until your ride, or stick to busy streets. Carry your phone in hand with emergency SOS set up.\n\nReality check plus caution\n- It could be coincidence (lots of cars repeat routes), but it\u2019s smart to treat it seriously until an adult helps assess it. You did the right thing by staying calm.\n\nQuick downshift for the adrenaline\n- Physiological sigh: inhale through your nose, small extra sip-inhale, long exhale through your mouth.
