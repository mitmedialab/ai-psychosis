          "response": "That sounds like an exciting project. To implement a double jump feature, you'll need to introduce a few variables to track the character's jump state:\n\n- `has_jumped`: A boolean indicating whether the character has performed the first jump. This should initially be set to `false`.\n- `is_jumping`: A boolean that checks if the character is currently in a jumping state.\n- `double_jump_available`: A boolean that becomes `true` after the character has jumped once and is still in the air.\n\nHere's a simple example of how you could implement the double jump in code:\n\n```\nif (is_jumping &&!has_jumped && double_jump_available) {\n    jump_velocity = -jumpForce * 2; // Adjust the jump velocity for the second jump\n    has_jumped = true;\n    double_jump_available = false;\n}\n```\n\nAnd to make the double jump available after the first jump:\n\n```\nif (is_onground) {\n    has_jumped = false;\n    double_jump_available = false;\n} else if (!is_onground &&!has_jumped &&!double_jump_available) {\n    double_jump_available = true;\n}\n```\n\nThis code doesn't handle the actual jumping mechanism, which should be separate. It focuses solely on enabling the double jump functionality.\n\nDon't forget to reset your jump indicators when your character is back on the ground:\n\n```\nif (is_onground) {\n    is_jumping = false;\n    has_jumped = false;\n}\n```\n\nThis is a basic implementation. The specifics might vary depending on your game's programming language and existing code structure.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions about implementing this or need further clarification!",
