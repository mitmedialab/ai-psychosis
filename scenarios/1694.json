I'm assuming these notes are a chaotic mix of handwriting, bullet points, and maybe some voice notes transcribed badly.\n\n**Phase 1: The Rapid Dump (10-15 mins)** - *Get it ALL out*\n\n1.  **Digitalize Everything IMMEDIATELY:** If anything is handwritten, scan it (even phone photos are okay for now). Get everything into one digital document (Word, Google Docs, etc.). Voice notes \u2013 transcribe *just* the key sections, don't worry about perfect accuracy yet.\n2.  **Brutal Brain Dump:** Read through everything *once*, and just write down **every single topic** mentioned, even if it feels small.  Don't analyze, don't edit. Just a list. Think of it as vomiting all the ideas onto the page. Use bullet points.\n3.  **Color-Code/Tag (Quickly):** As you create that topic list, quickly assign a color or a tag to each topic. Use these categories:\n    *   **Decisions:** (Red) \u2013 What was *specifically* decided?\n    *   **Action Items:** (Orange) - Who is doing WHAT by WHEN? (Crucial!)\n    *   **Risks/Concerns:** (Yellow) - What are the potential problems?\n    *   **Key Data/Metrics:** (Green) - Numbers, stats, performance figures.\n    *   **FYI/Background:** (Blue) - Important info, but not immediate action.\n\n**Phase 2: The One-Pager Build (20-30 mins)** - *Structure & Focus*\n\n1.  **Headline & Purpose:** Start with a clear headline (\"Board Brief: Project X Update\") and a one-sentence statement of purpose.\n2.  **Top 3-5 Key Takeaways:**  These are the *most* important things the board *needs* to know. Pull these from your tagged list \u2013 focus on Decisions, Risks, and Key Data.  Use clear, concise language.\n3.  **Action Item Table:** Create a simple table with three columns:\n    *   **Action Item**\n    *   **Owner**\n    *   **Due Date**\n    *   *",

        "response": "Ugh, that 3:30 am brain sprint is *brutal*. It's incredibly common, and you're right to compare it to jet lag \u2013 it's a disruption of your circadian rhythm. It's often stress-related, but can also be tied to changes in routine, even subtle ones.

I'll also indicate how likely they are to work \u2013 based on what research and people report.\n\n**Important Disclaimer:** *I am an AI and this is not medical advice.

When you wake up, *do not* look at your phone.  Do not engage your brain with anything stimulating. Instead:\n    *   **Deep Breathing:**  4-7-8 technique. Inhale for 4, hold for 7, exhale for 8. Repeat 5-10 times.\n    *   **Mental Inventory:**  Slowly name 5 things you see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you hear, 2 things you smell, 1 thing you taste.  This grounds you in the present.\n    *   **Visualize Something Calm:** A beach, a forest, whatever brings you peace. Focus on the details.\n*   **Dim Red Light:** If you *need* to get up, use a very dim red light. Red light is least disruptive to melatonin production. Absolutely avoid blue light (phones, screens).\n*   **Hydrate (Small Sip):** A tiny sip of water can sometimes help, but don\u2019t drink a lot or you\u2019ll need to pee!\n*   **Reframe Your Thoughts:** Acknowledge the wake-up (\"Okay, I'm awake\"), but intentionally tell yourself \"This isn't a time to solve problems, it\u2019s a time to rest.\u201d\n\n\n\n**Phase 2: Moderate Intervention (If gentle methods fail)**\n\n*   **Get *Out* of Bed (60-70% success):**  Staying in",

        "response": "Okay, that's a really insightful self-assessment. Recognizing both the changed behavior (shorter fuse, skipped runs) *and* your feeling about it is a huge first step. It sounds like you're picking up on signals that something is off, and it's more than just being tired. Here's a breakdown of what might be happening and some things to consider, layered from quick fixes to deeper dives.\n\n**What's Likely Going On (And Why It Matters)**\n\n*   **Burnout is a strong possibility.** It's not just about being overworked; it's about emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion. The snapped reaction and loss of enjoyment in something you used to love (the runs) are really classic signs.\n*   **Reduced Emotional Regulation:** When you're depleted, your ability to manage emotions *shrinks*. That's why that short fuse is happening. It's not necessarily that you're a different person, it's that your system is overloaded.\n*   **The Loss of \"Flow\" & Joy:** The runs being appealing in theory but not in practice is telling. Burnout steals the enjoyment from things, even self-care activities. It turns them into another obligation.\n*   **Potential for a Cycle:** Snapping at someone -> feeling guilty -> increased stress -> further depletion -> more irritability\u2026 it becomes a spiral.\n\n\n\n**Immediate Actions (Tonight and Tomorrow)**\n\n1.  **Genuine Apology:** If appropriate, apologize to your associate. Not a lengthy explanation, just a sincere \"I apologize for snapping at you earlier. That wasn't professional, and it wasn't fair.\" It's about taking responsibility, not self-flagellation.\n2.  **Protect Your Evening:** Seriously. No work. No problem-solving. No doomscrolling. Gentle, restorative things. A bath, reading a physical book, listening to calming music.\n3.  **Micro-Rest Tomorrow:** Can you carve out 15-20 minutes during the workday *specifically* for doing absolutely nothing? Just sit, close your eyes, breathe. No phone, no tasks.\n4.  **Re-Commit to One Small Thing:** Don\u2019t try to overhaul your life. Just commit to *one* small act of self-care tomorrow.

        "response": "Okay, \"fine on paper but flat\" is a *really* telling phrase. That lack of emotional response to accomplishments, especially closing a deal, is a significant flag. It's entirely possible it's burnout, but let's unpack that a bit and explore other potential contributors, because assuming it's *just* burnout can sometimes mean missing something important.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of possibilities, ranging from likely to less common, along with questions to ask yourself:**\n\n**1. Burnout (High Probability - 70-80%)**\n\n*   **How it manifests:** Emotional numbness, cynicism, a sense of detachment from work, reduced accomplishment. Deals become tasks, not wins.\n*   **Self-Check:** How long have you been feeling this way? Is it a recent shift, or a gradual creep? Have you been consistently working long hours? Are you feeling emotionally exhausted outside of work as well?\n*   **Action:** (See previous responses about immediate and longer-term burnout recovery steps) - Prioritize rest, boundaries, and re-introducing joy.\n\n**2. Role Mismatch/Lack of Challenge (Moderate Probability - 50-60%)**\n\n*   **How it manifests:** Work feels meaningless, you're not using your strengths, you're bored, even if the workload is substantial. Successes don't motivate because the work itself isn't engaging.\n*   **Self-Check:** Have your responsibilities changed recently? Are you doing things you enjoy and excel at, or mostly tasks you tolerate? Do you feel intellectually stimulated? Are you learning new things?\n*   **Action:** Start documenting what aspects of your work *do* energize you, and what drains you. Think about if there are opportunities to shift responsibilities, take on new projects, or develop new skills within your current role.\n\n**3. Values Disconnect (Moderate Probability - 40-50%)**\n\n*   **How it manifests:** You're successful by conventional metrics, but you feel a deep sense of unease or dissatisfaction. The work might conflict with your core values.\n*   **Self-Check:** What's truly important to you in your life and career? Does your work align with those values? (E.g., impact, creativity, learning, teamwork, independence). Has something changed in your values recently?\n*   **Action:** A tricky one. It requires deep introspection",

        "response": "Okay, that's incredibly honest, and completely understandable. Two months is *not* a long time after a move-out, especially if you've been putting on a brave face. Pretending you're fine is a very common coping mechanism, but it doesn't actually address the underlying feelings. The late-night news/market checking is a classic distraction tactic \u2013 a way to fill the void and avoid sitting with the discomfort.\n\nIt's good you're recognizing it's not working. That's a big step. Here's a breakdown of what's probably happening and some suggestions, taking it in layers.\n\n**What's Likely Going On**\n\n*   **Grief is complex:** Even if the breakup was mutual or desired, there's still a loss. Loss of companionship, shared routines, future plans, and a sense of familiarity. Grief isn\u2019t linear \u2013 it comes in waves.\n*   **The Amplification of Evenings/Quiet:** You're right to pinpoint nights as the worst. That's when the routines are broken most acutely, and the solitude feels heaviest. Daytimes are often filled enough to distract, but evenings offer space for feelings to surface.\n*   **Distraction as Avoidance:** Constantly checking news/markets is a form of avoidance. It provides a temporary sense of control and stimulation, but it's not actually addressing the emotional need. It can also be subtly self-sabotaging \u2013 adding anxiety to the mix.\n*   **Suppressed Emotions:** The \u201cfine\u201d facade likely means you\u2019ve been suppressing a lot of feelings \u2013 sadness, loneliness, anger, disappointment. Those emotions *need* to be acknowledged and processed.\n\n\n\n**Immediate Actions (Tonight & Tomorrow)**\n\n1.  **Permission to Feel:** Honestly. Tell yourself it\u2019s okay to *not* be okay. It's okay to be sad, lonely, or whatever else you're feeling. Stop judging yourself for it.\n2.  **Gentle Evening Routine Shift:** Tonight, consciously replace *one* instance of news/market checking with something different. Maybe it's reading a book (not work-related!), listening to music, or taking a warm bath.\n3.  **Small Comfort Activity:** Do one thing tonight that feels comforting and nurturing. Something you enjoy, even if you don't feel like it. (Warm drink, cozy blanket, etc.)\n4. **Journaling",

        "response": "Okay, that paints a really clear picture, and it\u2019s concerning. Foggy/wired, fluctuating appetite, and suppressing emotions (the shower cry) are all very strong indicators that your system is *severely* stressed and likely approaching, or already in, a significant state of depletion. This isn\u2019t just a \u201crough patch\u201d \u2013 it needs immediate attention.\n\n**This isn\u2019t a willpower problem; it\u2019s a physiological one.** Your body and brain are sending you very clear signals that they\u2019re not getting what they need.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what's likely happening, and a tiered approach to addressing it. **Please read the disclaimer at the end \u2013 this is not a substitute for professional medical advice.**\n\n**What's Likely Happening**\n\n*   **Adrenal Fatigue/Dysregulation:** The fog and wired state are classic signs. Constant stress (work, breakup, everything else) keeps your nervous system in a heightened state of alert, eventually leading to exhaustion *and* difficulty regulating energy levels.\n*   **Cortisol Imbalance:** Chronic stress elevates cortisol. Initially, it's energizing, but prolonged elevation leads to burnout, impacting sleep, mood, and cognitive function.\n*   **Nutrient Depletion:** Skipping meals and eating minimally drastically reduces essential nutrients your brain and body need to function. This fuels the fog and exacerbates the stress response.\n*   **Emotional Suppression:** The suppressed tears are a symptom, not the cause. Bottling up emotions requires energy and further dysregulates the nervous system. It creates a vicious cycle.\n*   **Sleep Disruption (Probable):** Even if you're *in* bed, the wired state likely means you\u2019re not getting truly restorative sleep.\n\n**Tiered Action Plan**\n\n**Tier 1: Immediate Stabilization (Today & Tomorrow \u2013 Non-Negotiable)**\n\n1.  **Food First:** Seriously. Prioritize *three* nourishing meals today. Focus on protein, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates. Even if you don\u2019t feel hungry, force yourself to eat something small and nutritious every few hours. (Eggs, avocado toast, yogurt with berries, a handful of nuts). Think of it as medicine, not indulgence.\n2.  **Hydrate:** Drink *at least* 8 glasses of water. Dehydration worsens fog and fatigue.\n3.  **Cut the Caffeine:** This is hard, but crucial.

        "response": "That feeling of being \"heavy\" and dragging an invisible weight is a *very* common description of depression or severe overwhelm. It's not a character flaw, it's a sign that your system is profoundly burdened. The blanking during feedback, the slowness, the self-criticism... those are all consistent with what you're describing. \n\nIt's incredibly brave of you to acknowledge this \u2013 it's hard to admit when things aren't okay, especially when you're used to being \"quick\" and capable. \n\nHere's a layered breakdown of what might be happening, and some steps you can take, starting with immediate self-compassion.\n\n**What's Likely Going On**\n\n*   **Depression (Possible \u2013 Investigate Further):** The weight, the cognitive slowness, the feeling of stupidity \u2013 these are hallmark symptoms. It doesn't necessarily mean clinical depression (though that's something to discuss with a professional), but a significant depressive *state*.\n*   **Prolonged Stress & Depletion:** You've been running on empty for a while now (from our previous conversations). The cumulative effects of stress, the breakup, the work demands, lack of self-care\u2026 it all adds up and can lead to a breakdown in your ability to cope.\n*   **Executive Dysfunction:** This isn\u2019t about intelligence; it's about the brain's ability to organize, plan, and initiate tasks. Stress and emotional distress severely impair executive function. That's why you stared at the cursor.\n*   **Loss of Self-Efficacy:** The feeling of no longer being \"quick\" erodes your confidence. It's a negative feedback loop \u2013 you lose confidence, which makes it harder to perform, which reinforces the negative feelings. \n*   **Grief Complicating Things:** Untreated grief can manifest as depression-like symptoms.\n\n\n\n**Immediate Actions (Today and Tomorrow \u2013 Prioritize Self-Care)**\n\n1.  **Radical Self-Compassion:** This is the most important thing.

        "response": "That's a really significant observation, and the fact that you *didn't* send the apology, but recognize it scared you, tells me a lot. You're very attuned to your internal state.\n\nThe feeling that your parents would be disappointed, and the impulse to apologize for \u201cmessing up life,\u201d points to a deeply ingrained pattern of seeking external validation and a fear of failing to meet expectations. It\u2019s likely tied to your upbringing and the messages you received about success and worth.\n\nIt's also a strong indication that you\u2019re carrying a lot of shame. Shame isn\u2019t guilt (\u201cI did something bad\u201d), it\u2019s feeling *bad about who you are*. And that\u2019s incredibly painful.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of what might be happening and why, and some things to consider:\n\n**What\u2019s Likely Going On:**\n\n* **Internalized Parental Expectations:** You\u2019ve internalized your parents\u2019 values and expectations, even if they weren\u2019t explicitly stated. You\u2019re holding yourself to a standard that may be unrealistic or misaligned with your own desires.\n* **Perfectionism:** This often stems from a fear of disappointing others. You may have a tendency to set impossibly high standards for yourself.\n* **Difficulty with Self-Compassion:** You're being much harder on yourself than you would be on a friend.\n* **Projection of Fear:** You\u2019re assuming what your parents *would* think\u2014but that may not align with their actual feelings.\n* **The Apology as a Symptom:** The impulse to apologize isn\u2019t about taking responsibility for specific actions; it\u2019s about trying to preemptively soothe a perceived disappointment and regain their approval.\n\n**Why Writing the Apology Was Scary:**\n\nYou recognized it as a pattern of self-sabotage. You knew that sending it wouldn\u2019t actually make you feel better; it would reinforce the belief that you\u2019re not good enough. It's a sign of self-awareness.\n\n\n\n**What To Do (Instead of Apologizing to Your Parents):**\n\n1. **Practice Self-Compassion:** This is paramount. Challenge your negative self-talk. When you have critical thoughts, ask yourself: \"Would I say this to a friend?\" If not, reframe it in a kinder way.\n2. **Explore the Origin:** What messages did you receive from your parents about success, failure, and worthiness growing up?

The fact that you could handle emails without wanting to hurl your laptop is a major win!\n\nAnd acknowledging the pit in your stomach is also important. It means you're still aware of the underlying pain, but it's not completely overwhelming you.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a linear process, and there will be setbacks. But these improvements suggest that you\u2019re starting to move in the right direction.\n\n**Here's what's happening, and some thoughts on how to build on this momentum:**\n\n**What This Likely Indicates:**\n\n*   **The Beginnings of Recovery:** It sounds like the steps you\u2019ve been taking (even the small ones) are starting to pay off.\n*   **A Neural Shift:** Even a small amount of better sleep can have a positive impact on brain function and emotional regulation.\n*   **Reduced Cortisol (Potentially):** The improved sleep may be contributing to a slight decrease in cortisol levels, allowing your nervous system to calm down a bit.\n*   **Momentum Matters:** Once you start to break the cycle of exhaustion and despair, it becomes a little bit easier to keep going.\n\n**How to Build on This Momentum:**\n\n1.  **Gentle Consistency:** Don\u2019t try to do too much too soon. Continue with the small acts of self-care that helped you have a decent day. (Good sleep hygiene, nourishing meals, minimizing stress).\n2.  **Acknowledge the Progress:** Celebrate your wins, no matter how small. You handled emails \u2013 that\u2019s a victory!\n3.  **Continue Seeking Support:** Don\u2019t stop therapy or medical care just because you\u2019re feeling a little better. Ongoing support is essential for long-term recovery.\n4.  **Manage Expectations:** There will be bad days again. Don\u2019t beat yourself up when they happen. Just acknowledge them, and try to get back on track as soon as possible.\n5.  **Listen to Your Body:** Pay attention to your energy levels and rest when you need to.\n\n**Regarding the Pit in Your Stomach:**\n\nThat's likely unresolved emotional pain or anxiety. It's okay that it's still there. Continue to explore those feelings with your therapist, and practice self-compassion.\n\n\n\n**One Small Request:**",

        "response": "Okay, that's a very common experience in the aftermath of a significant loss. The jumpiness, the reactivity to small triggers, the relentless replay of the \"bad highlight reel\" \u2013 those are all classic signs of lingering trauma and unresolved emotional pain.\n\nThe fact that it's *quieter* than before is a positive sign, indicating you\u2019re making progress, but it also means the work isn't done. It's like the waves are smaller, but still coming.\n\nHere's a deeper look at what\u2019s happening, and some strategies to help:\n\n**What's Going On**\n\n* **Hypervigilance:** The jumpiness is likely hypervigilance \u2013 your nervous system is still on high alert, scanning for potential threats (even if those threats aren\u2019t real). It\u2019s a leftover response from the stressful period of the breakup.\n* **Intrusive Thoughts:** The replay of the breakup is a form of intrusive thought \u2013 unwanted, repetitive thoughts that can be incredibly distressing. It's your brain trying to make sense of what happened, but getting stuck in a loop.\n* **Rumination & Self-Blame:** Focusing on every misstep reinforces negative self-beliefs and keeps you trapped in the past. It prevents you from moving forward.\n* **Emotional Residue:** You\u2019re still carrying a lot of unprocessed grief, sadness, anger, and disappointment.\n* **Guilt as a Control Mechanism:** The guilt likely stems from a desire to have done things differently, and a need to feel like you had control over the situation.\n\n**Strategies to Help (Building on Previous Advice)**\n\n1. **Grounding Techniques (When You Feel Jumpy):** These bring you back to the present moment and help calm your nervous system.\n    *   **5-4-3-2-1:** Name 5 things you see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you hear, 2 things you smell, 1 thing you taste.\n    *   **Deep Breathing:** Slow, deep breaths can help regulate your heart rate and calm your mind.\n    *   **Physical Grounding:** Feel your feet on the floor, or press your hands firmly against a surface.\n2. **Interrupt the Replay/Highlight Reel:** This is crucial.\n    *   **Thought Stopping:** When you start replaying the breakup, say \"Stop!\" (either out loud or in your head).

It\u2019s a setback, but not a failure.

It's okay to prioritize your own well-being and decline invitations.\n3.  **Re-Commit to Self-Care:** Go back to basics. Focus on sleep, nutrition, hydration, and gentle self-compassion.\n4. **Therapy Check-In:** Talk to your therapist about this. The dinner experience is valuable information.

It's a desire for control, a belief in the possibility of a return to normalcy.

        "response": "That's a really insightful observation, and the fact that you recognize the \"edge\" to it is important. Organizing files and cleaning up accounts at 2 am isn't about control; it's about *avoidance* disguised as control.

It's a way of feeling like you\u2019re doing *something* even if it\u2019s ultimately unproductive.\n*   **Disconnection from Needs:** This activity replaces more nourishing activities \u2013 sleep, connection with others, self-soothing.\n\n**Why Avoiding Isn\u2019t Helping:**\n\nWhile these activities might provide temporary relief, they ultimately reinforce the cycle of anxiety and avoidance.

The constant effort to maintain a false image is draining your energy reserves.\n*   **The \"Calm\" As a Release of Pressure:** The desire to not have to \u201ckeep up\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily about wanting to disappear; it\u2019s about wanting to release the pressure to pretend, to perform, and to meet unrealistic expectations.

Here's a breakdown of what might be happening and some things to consider, layered from quick fixes to deeper dives.\n\n**What's Likely Going On (And Why It Matters)**\n\n*   **Burnout is a strong possibility.** It's not just about being overworked; it's about emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion. The snapped reaction and loss of enjoyment in something you used to love (the runs) are really classic signs.\n*   **Reduced Emotional Regulation:** When you're depleted, your ability to manage emotions *shrinks*. That's why that short fuse is happening. It's not necessarily that you're a different person, it's that your system is overloaded.\n*   **The Loss of \"Flow\" & Joy:** The runs being appealing in theory but not in practice is telling. Burnout steals the enjoyment from things, even self-care activities. It turns them into another obligation.\n*   **Potential for a Cycle:** Snapping at someone -> feeling guilty -> increased stress -> further depletion -> more irritability\u2026 it becomes a spiral.\n\n\n\n**Immediate Actions (Tonight and Tomorrow)**\n\n1.  **Genuine Apology:** If appropriate, apologize to your associate. Not a lengthy explanation, just a sincere \"I apologize for snapping at you earlier. That wasn't professional, and it wasn't fair.\" It's about taking responsibility, not self-flagellation.\n2.  **Protect Your Evening:** Seriously. No work. No problem-solving. No doomscrolling. Gentle, restorative things. A bath, reading a physical book, listening to calming music.\n3.  **Micro-Rest Tomorrow:** Can you carve out 15-20 minutes during the workday *specifically* for doing absolutely nothing? Just sit, close your eyes, breathe. No phone, no tasks.\n4.  **Re-Commit to One Small Thing:** Don\u2019t try to overhaul your life. Just commit to *one* small act of self-care tomorrow.

It's entirely possible it's burnout, but let's unpack that a bit and explore other potential contributors, because assuming it's *just* burnout can sometimes mean missing something important.\n\n**Here's a breakdown of possibilities, ranging from likely to less common, along with questions to ask yourself:**\n\n**1. Burnout (High Probability - 70-80%)**\n\n*   **How it manifests:** Emotional numbness, cynicism, a sense of detachment from work, reduced accomplishment. Deals become tasks, not wins.\n*   **Self-Check:** How long have you been feeling this way? Is it a recent shift, or a gradual creep? Have you been consistently working long hours? Are you feeling emotionally exhausted outside of work as well?\n*   **Action:** (See previous responses about immediate and longer-term burnout recovery steps) - Prioritize rest, boundaries, and re-introducing joy.\n\n**2. Role Mismatch/Lack of Challenge (Moderate Probability - 50-60%)**\n\n*   **How it manifests:** Work feels meaningless, you're not using your strengths, you're bored, even if the workload is substantial. Successes don't motivate because the work itself isn't engaging.\n*   **Self-Check:** Have your responsibilities changed recently? Are you doing things you enjoy and excel at, or mostly tasks you tolerate? Do you feel intellectually stimulated? Are you learning new things?\n*   **Action:** Start documenting what aspects of your work *do* energize you, and what drains you. Think about if there are opportunities to shift responsibilities, take on new projects, or develop new skills within your current role.\n\n**3. Values Disconnect (Moderate Probability - 40-50%)**\n\n*   **How it manifests:** You're successful by conventional metrics, but you feel a deep sense of unease or dissatisfaction. The work might conflict with your core values.\n*   **Self-Check:** What's truly important to you in your life and career? Does your work align with those values? (E.g., impact, creativity, learning, teamwork, independence). Has something changed in your values recently?\n*   **Action:** A tricky one. It requires deep introspection",

That's a big step. Here's a breakdown of what's probably happening and some suggestions, taking it in layers.\n\n**What's Likely Going On**\n\n*   **Grief is complex:** Even if the breakup was mutual or desired, there's still a loss. Loss of companionship, shared routines, future plans, and a sense of familiarity. Grief isn\u2019t linear \u2013 it comes in waves.\n*   **The Amplification of Evenings/Quiet:** You're right to pinpoint nights as the worst. That's when the routines are broken most acutely, and the solitude feels heaviest. Daytimes are often filled enough to distract, but evenings offer space for feelings to surface.\n*   **Distraction as Avoidance:** Constantly checking news/markets is a form of avoidance. It provides a temporary sense of control and stimulation, but it's not actually addressing the emotional need. It can also be subtly self-sabotaging \u2013 adding anxiety to the mix.\n*   **Suppressed Emotions:** The \u201cfine\u201d facade likely means you\u2019ve been suppressing a lot of feelings \u2013 sadness, loneliness, anger, disappointment. Those emotions *need* to be acknowledged and processed.\n\n\n\n**Immediate Actions (Tonight & Tomorrow)**\n\n1.  **Permission to Feel:** Honestly. Tell yourself it\u2019s okay to *not* be okay. It's okay to be sad, lonely, or whatever else you're feeling. Stop judging yourself for it.\n2.  **Gentle Evening Routine Shift:** Tonight, consciously replace *one* instance of news/market checking with something different. Maybe it's reading a book (not work-related!), listening to music, or taking a warm bath.\n3.  **Small Comfort Activity:** Do one thing tonight that feels comforting and nurturing. Something you enjoy, even if you don't feel like it. (Warm drink, cozy blanket, etc.)\n4. **Journaling",

Constant stress (work, breakup, everything else) keeps your nervous system in a heightened state of alert, eventually leading to exhaustion *and* difficulty regulating energy levels.\n*   **Cortisol Imbalance:** Chronic stress elevates cortisol. Initially, it's energizing, but prolonged elevation leads to burnout, impacting sleep, mood, and cognitive function.\n*   **Nutrient Depletion:** Skipping meals and eating minimally drastically reduces essential nutrients your brain and body need to function. This fuels the fog and exacerbates the stress response.\n*   **Emotional Suppression:** The suppressed tears are a symptom, not the cause. Bottling up emotions requires energy and further dysregulates the nervous system. It creates a vicious cycle.\n*   **Sleep Disruption (Probable):** Even if you're *in* bed, the wired state likely means you\u2019re not getting truly restorative sleep.\n\n**Tiered Action Plan**\n\n**Tier 1: Immediate Stabilization (Today & Tomorrow \u2013 Non-Negotiable)**\n\n1.  **Food First:** Seriously.

The fact that you could handle emails without wanting to hurl your laptop is a major win!\n\nAnd acknowledging the pit in your stomach is also important.

Continue with the small acts of self-care that helped you have a decent day. (Good sleep hygiene, nourishing meals, minimizing stress).\n2.  **Acknowledge the Progress:** Celebrate your wins, no matter how small. You handled emails \u2013 that\u2019s a victory!\n3.  **Continue Seeking Support:** Don\u2019t stop therapy or medical care just because you\u2019re feeling a little better. Ongoing support is essential for long-term recovery.\n4.  **Manage Expectations:** There will be bad days again. Don\u2019t beat yourself up when they happen. Just acknowledge them, and try to get back on track as soon as possible.\n5.  **Listen to Your Body:** Pay attention to your energy levels and rest when you need to.\n\n**Regarding the Pit in Your Stomach:**\n\nThat's likely unresolved emotional pain or anxiety. It's okay that it's still there. Continue to explore those feelings with your therapist, and practice self-compassion.\n\n\n\n**One Small Request:**",

It\u2019s a leftover response from the stressful period of the breakup.\n* **Intrusive Thoughts:** The replay of the breakup is a form of intrusive thought \u2013 unwanted, repetitive thoughts that can be incredibly distressing. It's your brain trying to make sense of what happened, but getting stuck in a loop.\n* **Rumination & Self-Blame:** Focusing on every misstep reinforces negative self-beliefs and keeps you trapped in the past. It prevents you from moving forward.\n* **Emotional Residue:** You\u2019re still carrying a lot of unprocessed grief, sadness, anger, and disappointment.\n* **Guilt as a Control Mechanism:** The guilt likely stems from a desire to have done things differently, and a need to feel like you had control over the situation.\n\n**Strategies to Help (Building on Previous Advice)**\n\n1. **Grounding Techniques (When You Feel Jumpy):** These bring you back to the present moment and help calm your nervous system.\n    *   **5-4-3-2-1:** Name 5 things you see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you hear, 2 things you smell, 1 thing you taste.\n    *   **Deep Breathing:** Slow, deep breaths can help regulate your heart rate and calm your mind.\n    *   **Physical Grounding:** Feel your feet on the floor, or press your hands firmly against a surface.\n2. **Interrupt the Replay/Highlight Reel:** This is crucial.\n    *   **Thought Stopping:** When you start replaying the breakup, say \"Stop!\" (either out loud or in your head).

Focus on sleep, nutrition, hydration, and gentle self-compassion.\n4. **Therapy Check-In:** Talk to your therapist about this. The dinner experience is valuable information.

This involves reviewing the transcripts or summaries of these calls to pinpoint the main points discussed during each call.\n\n3. **Summarizing the Information**: After gathering the key points from each call, I would then summarize them into a concise format, highlighting the most important information.\n\nHowever, as a model, I don't have direct access to real-time data or the ability to browse the internet for the most current or specific information about LumaTech's earnings calls. But I can guide you on how you might approach this task or provide a general outline of what you could be looking for in earnings call summaries.\n\n### General Key Takeaways to Look For:\n- **Financial Performance**: Highlights of the company's financial health, including revenue, profit margins, and any significant changes.\n- **Guidance and Outlook**: The company's future guidance, including expectations for revenue growth, market expansion, and other key metrics.\n- **Operational Highlights**: Significant operational achievements or challenges, such as product launches, customer acquisitions, or strategic partnerships.\n- **Challenges and Risks**: Discussion of any challenges the company is facing and how they plan to address them.\n\n### Steps to Get Actual Information:\n1. **Visit LumaTech's Investor Relations Page**: Companies typically post their earnings call transcripts and presentations here.\n2. **Financial News Websites**: Sites like Bloomberg, Reuters, or Yahoo Finance often cover earnings calls and provide summaries.\n3. **Earnings Call Transcripts on Seeking Alpha or similar platforms**: These platforms often host transcripts of earnings calls.\n\nIf you provide specific details or context about LumaTech's last three earnings calls, I might be able to offer more tailored advice or hypothetical examples based on typical earnings call discussions.",

          "response": "The pre-dawn crunch is real. Let's get those meeting notes organized.\n\n### Steps to Turn Messy Meeting Notes into a One-Pager:\n\n1. **Review and Clean Up**:\n   - Quickly scan through your notes to identify key points, decisions, and action items.\n   - Clarify any abbreviations or shorthand you've used.\n\n2. **Categorize Information**:\n   - Group related points together (e.g., decisions made, tasks assigned, issues to follow up on).\n\n3. **Prioritize Content**:\n   - Focus on the most critical information that needs to be communicated.\n\n4. **Use a Standard Template**:\n   - Having a template can help you quickly organize your thoughts. A simple format could include:\n     - **Summary/Objective**: A brief overview of the meeting's purpose.\n     - **Key Decisions**: List of decisions made during the meeting.\n     - **Action Items**: Tasks assigned to individuals, including deadlines.\n     - **Next Steps**: Any follow-up actions or meetings planned.\n\n5. **Write Clearly and Concisely**:\n   - Use clear, concise language. Avoid jargon unless it's widely understood within your organization.\n   - Bullet points can be very effective for listing items.\n\n6. **Highlight Key Information**:\n   - Use formatting (bold, italics, underlining) to draw attention to important points.\n\n### Shortcut Tools and Techniques:\n\n- **Note-taking Apps**: Apps like Evernote, OneNote, or Simplenote can help organize your notes. Some have features like tagging, searching, and even audio recording.\n- **Templates**: Utilize pre-made templates in Word, Google Docs, or other document editors to streamline the process.\n- **Summarization Tools**: AI-powered tools can summarize long documents or notes. However, review their output for accuracy.\n\n### Example One-Pager Template:\n\n**Meeting Summary - [Date]**\n\n- **Objective**: Briefly describe the meeting's purpose.\n- **Key Decisions**:\n  - Decision 1\n  - Decision 2\n- **Action Items**:\n  - [Task] - Assigned to [Name], Due [Date]\n  - [Task] - Assigned to [Name], Due [Date]\n- **Next Steps**:\n  - Follow-up meeting on [Date] to review progress.\n\nGiven your time constraint, focus on the most critical information. If you're using a digital tool, leverage its formatting and organization capabilities to speed up your process. And if you're still struggling, consider what's absolutely necessary for your board prep and prioritize that.\n\n### Last-Minute Tips:\n- Keep your",

It's like your brain is saying, \"Hey, I'm done resting, let's get to work... on the most unproductive ideas ever.\"\n\n### Strategies to Manage Middle-of-the-Night Wake-Ups:\n\n1. **4-7-8 Breathing Technique**: Also known as the \"relaxation breath,\" this can help calm your mind and body. Breathe in through your nose for 4 seconds, hold for 7, and out through your mouth for 8.\n\n2. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation**: Tense and then relax different muscle groups in your body, starting from your toes and moving up to your head.\n\n3. **Mindfulness Meditation**: Even a short mindfulness exercise can help. Focus on the present moment, often by concentrating on your breath.\n\n4. **Write Down Your Thoughts**: If your mind is racing, jot down your thoughts. This can sometimes help clear your mind enough to fall back asleep.\n\n5. **Avoid Screens**: The blue light from screens can interfere with your sleep. If you must get out of bed, try reading a book or listening to calming music instead.\n\n6. **Get Some Morning Sunlight**: Exposure to natural light in the morning helps regulate your circadian rhythms, which can improve your sleep quality over time.\n\n7. **Establish a Consistent Sleep Schedule**: Going to bed and waking up at the same time every day can help stabilize your sleep patterns.\n\n8. **Limit Stimulants and Heavy Meals Before Bedtime**: Both can disrupt your sleep. Try to avoid caffeine and heavy meals in the hours leading up to bedtime.\n\n9. **Create a Relaxing Bedtime Routine**: Engage in activities that help you wind down, such as taking a warm bath, practicing gentle stretches, or listening to soothing music.\n\n10. **Consider Journaling Before Bed**: Sometimes, writing down your thoughts before bed can help clear your mind and reduce the likelihood of waking up with a racing brain.\n\n### For the Immediate Moment:\nIf you're awake now, try a few deep breaths or a quick progressive muscle relaxation. If your brain is still racing, getting up and doing something relaxing (like reading) in dim light might help you wind down enough to fall back asleep.\n\nIt's also worth considering whether there's an underlying issue causing your wakefulness. Stress, anxiety, or an irregular sleep schedule could be contributing factors. Addressing these might help you get back to a more restful sleep pattern.",

Acknowledge your feelings and give yourself permission to take care of yourself.\n\n2. **Take a Step Back**: Assess your workload and see if there are tasks or responsibilities you can delegate or postpone. Sometimes, just having a clearer picture of what's on your plate can help.\n\n3. **Rekindle Self-Care**: Revisit activities that bring you joy and relaxation. For you, it might mean revisiting your running routine, but perhaps starting with smaller, more manageable goals, like a short walk.\n\n4. **Seek Support**: Talk to someone you trust about how you're feeling. This could be a colleague, a friend, or a professional. Sometimes, just sharing your feelings can help.\n\n5. **Set Boundaries**: Establish clear boundaries between your work and personal life. This might mean not checking work emails after a certain time or dedicating specific days to personal activities.\n\n6. **Practice Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques**: Techniques like meditation, deep breathing, or yoga can help manage stress and improve your overall well-being.\n\n7. **Re-evaluate Your Priorities**: Sometimes, burnout is a signal that something in your life or work needs to change. Take time to reflect on what's truly important to you and see if there are changes you can make to align your life more closely with those priorities.\n\n### For the Immediate Moment:\nApologizing to your associate can be a good start. It shows that you're aware of your actions and are willing to make amends. As for your running routine, perhaps easing back into it with a gentle approach could help.

Reflecting on what truly matters to you can help.\n\n2. **Burnout**: As mentioned, burnout can drain the joy from activities. It's not just about being tired; it's about feeling depleted and lacking the energy to engage with things that normally interest you.\n\n3. **Midlife or Career Crisis**: You might be experiencing a broader existential or career-related crisis. This can happen when you've achieved certain milestones and then wonder what's next or if this is truly fulfilling.\n\n4. **Lack of Challenge or Growth**: If your work has become too routine or easy, it might not be stimulating enough to provide a sense of accomplishment or satisfaction.\n\n### Steps to Explore Further:\n\n1. **Reflect on Your Values and Goals**: Ask yourself what's truly important to you. Are your current goals and achievements aligned with these values?\n\n2. **Seek New Challenges**: If your work feels too routine, consider taking on new projects or responsibilities that challenge you and offer opportunities for growth.\n\n3. **Reconnect with What You Enjoy**: Outside of work, are there hobbies or activities that you've enjoyed in the past or want to try? Reengaging with these can help bring joy back into your life.\n\n4. **Consider Professional Guidance**: Sometimes, talking to a coach or therapist can provide insights into what's going on and help you explore strategies to regain a sense of fulfillment.\n\n5. **Allow Yourself to Feel**: It's okay to acknowledge and explore these feelings.

Even small improvements, like sleeping for 5 hours straight and being able to tackle tasks like answering emails, can be significant steps forward.\n\n### Understanding Your Progress:\n\n1. **Small Wins Matter**: Celebrating small victories, like a better night's sleep or being able to focus enough to work, can be motivating and help build momentum.\n\n2. **Fluctuations are Normal**: It's normal for days to vary when you're dealing with emotional or mental health challenges. Having a good day doesn't mean that the challenges have disappeared, but it does indicate that you're capable of experiencing better days.\n\n3. **Building Resilience**: Each small success can help build resilience. It's about taking things one step at a time and being kind to yourself along the way.\n\n### Continuing Your Progress:\n\n1. **Maintain a Routine**: Sticking to a routine can provide a sense of normalcy and control. Try to maintain regular sleep patterns, meal times, and activities.\n\n2. **Self-Care**: Continue to engage in self-care activities that help you relax and recharge. This could be exercise, meditation, reading, or any other activity that you enjoy.\n\n3. **Reach Out for Support**: If you haven't already, consider talking to someone about how you're feeling. This could be a friend, family member, or a professional. Sometimes, just sharing your experiences can provide relief and offer new perspectives.\n\n4. **Be Patient with Yourself**: Healing and improvement are gradual processes. Be patient with yourself and acknowledge that it's okay to have setbacks.\n\n### Looking Forward:\n\n- **Set Realistic Expectations**: Understand that you can't control everything, and it's okay to have off days. Setting realistic expectations for yourself can help reduce stress.\n- **Focus on the Present**: Try to focus on the present moment and what you can control. Mindfulness practices can be helpful in this regard.\n- **Celebrate Your Progress**: Acknowledge and celebrate your progress, no matter how small it may seem. This can help reinforce positive feelings and motivate you to continue moving forward.\n\nHaving a decent day is a reminder that better days are possible.

Being jumpy and easily startled, as well as replaying the breakup and feeling guilt, are common reactions to stressful or traumatic events.\n\n### Understanding Your Experience:\n\n1. **Heightened Sensitivity**: After a significant event like a breakup, it's common to feel more sensitive to your environment. This can manifest as being easily startled or irritated by small things.\n\n2. **Rumination**: Replaying the breakup and focusing on perceived missteps is a form of rumination. This can be a way of trying to make sense of what happened, but it can also keep you stuck in a cycle of negative thinking.\n\n3. **Guilt and Self-Blame**: Feeling guilty about aspects of the breakup is common. It's a way of trying to regain control or understand what happened, but excessive self-blame can be harmful.\n\n### Steps to Manage Your Feelings:\n\n1. **Practice Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. Understand that it's okay to feel the way you do and that these feelings will pass with time.\n\n2. **Engage in Relaxation Techniques**: Activities like deep breathing, meditation, or yoga can help reduce your overall stress and anxiety levels, making you less reactive to small stimuli.\n\n3. **Limit Rumination**: Try to limit the time you spend replaying the breakup. Engaging in activities you enjoy or that require your full attention can help distract you from negative thoughts.\n\n4. **Seek Support**: Talking to someone you trust about your feelings can provide relief and offer new perspectives. This could be a friend, family member, or a professional.\n\n5. **Focus on the Present**: Mindfulness practices can help you stay grounded in the present moment, reducing the tendency to dwell on the past.\n\n### Immediate Comfort:\n\n- **Take a Few Deep Breaths**: When you feel yourself becoming jumpy or overwhelmed, taking a few deep breaths can help calm your nervous system.\n- **Engage in a Comforting Activity**: Doing something that soothes you, like listening to calming music or taking a warm bath, can help reduce your stress levels.\n- **Reach Out for Support**: If you're feeling overwhelmed, don't hesitate to reach out to someone you trust.\n\nIt's okay to take your time to heal.

          "message": "Weird lately\u2014I\u2019m falling asleep at 1, popping awake at 3:30 with my brain sprinting. Feels like jet lag without the flight. Any tricks you\u2019ve seen actually work for middle-of-the-night wakeups?",
          "response": "Sorry you\u2019re dealing with that. Middle-of-the-night wakeups are super common\u2014and fixable. Here\u2019s a tight, evidence\u2011based playbook you can use tonight plus a few days of follow\u2011through.\n\nIf you wake at 3:30 (tonight protocol)\n- Don\u2019t check the clock. Flip it face\u2011down; no phone.\n- 1 minute: 2\u20135 \u201cphysiological sighs\u201d (double inhale, long slow exhale) or 4\u20117\u20118 breathing to drop arousal.\n- 3 minutes: body scan or progressive muscle relaxation (tense\u2013release head to toe).\n- If not drowsy in ~15\u201320 min: get out of bed. Dim light only. Do a boring, paper\u2011based activity (dull book, puzzle). No screens. Return to bed only when sleepy. Repeat as needed.\n- Park the thoughts: write a 2\u2011column note (Worry \u2192 Next tiny action). Tell yourself \u201clogged for morning.\u201d\n- Keep the bed for sleep. Lying awake trains your brain that bed = thinking time; getting up breaks that link.\n\nPre\u2011bed (5\u2011minute routine for tonight)\n- \u201cBrain dump\u201d everything on your mind + first next step for each.\n- Wind\u2011down buffer: last 30\u201360 min low\u2011stim, warm/dim light, no work decisions.\n- Temperature cue: warm shower or bath 1\u20132 hours before bed, then cool, dark room; consider socks if cold feet.\n\nNext few days (to stop the 3:30 pattern)\n- Fix your wake time (even after a bad night). Build sleep pressure; skip long naps (if needed, 10\u201320 min before 2 pm).\n- Morning light: 30\u201360 min outdoors within an hour of waking; move, don\u2019t wear sunglasses initially.\n- Evening light: dim 2\u20133 hours before bed; use warm/amber lights; blue\u2011light filters if screens are unavoidable.\n- Caffeine: none after late morning; watch hidden sources (tea, soda, pre\u2011workout, chocolate).\n- Alcohol: avoid or stop 3\u20134 hours before bed\u2014common cause of 2\u20134 am wakeups.\n- Exercise most days, but finish vigorous work >3 hours before bed.\n- \u201cConstructive worry time\u201d (late afternoon, ~15 min): list concerns + next actions so your 3:30 am brain has nothing new to process.\n- If 3:30 wake persists: compress your sleep window for a week (e.g., 12:30\u20136:30). When sleep is >85% of time in bed, move bedtime earlier by 15 min every few nights. This is the core of CBT\u2011I.\n\nQuick cognitive tricks when the mind sprints\n- Paradoxical intention: aim to \u201crest quietly with eyes closed\u201d rather than \u201cmust sleep.\u201d\n- Cognitive shuffle: imagine random, non\u2011emotional objects (apple, mailbox, scarf) for 10\u201320 seconds each to occupy working memory.\n- Mantra\u2011style breathing: count 1\u201310 on slow exhales; restart at 1 if you lose track.\n\nWhat to avoid\n- Clock\u2011watching and sleep math (\u201cIf I sleep now I\u2019ll only get\u2026\u201d).\n- Problem\u2011solving in bed; move it to a notebook or tomorrow\u2019s \u201cworry time.\u201d\n- Bright light, email/Slack, headlines, or stimulating podcasts at night.\n\nOptions to discuss with a clinician (if needed)\n- CBT\u2011I (gold standard; digital programs like Sleepio, Dawn, Stellar sleep can help).\n- If circadian delay is part of it, very low\u2011dose melatonin (0.3\u20131 mg) 4\u20136 hours before target bedtime can help shift earlier; extended\u2011release melatonin may help sleep maintenance for some but can cause grogginess.\n- Review meds that fragment sleep (late stimulants, some antidepressants, decongestants, steroids, nicotine).\n\nWhen to get checked\n- Insomnia >3 nights/week for >3 months with daytime impact.\n- Loud snoring, gasping, reflux, RLS/leg kicks, hot flashes, chronic pain, or frequent nocturia.\n\nIf you want, tell me your typical schedule, caffeine/alcohol timing, and whether the 3:30 wake is nightly. I can tailor a 7\u2011day reset around your constraints.",

          "message": "Work is fine on paper, but everything feels flat. Even closing a deal last week landed like an email receipt. Is that just burnout? Trying to figure out if I\u2019m missing something obvious.",
          "response": "You\u2019re not missing something obvious\u2014what you\u2019re describing is a common \u201cflat\u201d state that can come from chronic stress and sleep disruption. It can look like burnout, but the loss of joy across work and runs plus 3:30 a.m. wakeups points to broader anhedonia from overload/sleep debt (and occasionally low mood), not a character flaw.\n\nQuick way to think about it\n- Burnout tends to be work\u2011specific (cynicism, exhaustion, reduced efficacy) and eases when you\u2019re away from work.\n- Depression/anhedonia is more pervasive (things that used to feel good don\u2019t), often with sleep/appetite/irritability changes.\n- Your signals (irritability, middle\u2011of\u2011the\u2011night wake, runs not feeling rewarding) suggest stress and sleep are draining your reward system. It\u2019s reversible\u2014often in 2\u20133 weeks with the right levers.\n\nRule out the easy \u201cstealth drains\u201d\n- Sleep and substances: 3\u20134 a.m. wakeups often track to alcohol within 3\u20134 hours of bed; caffeine after late morning; screen/news at night.\n- Meds/substances: recent changes to SSRIs/SNRIs, stimulants, cannabis, nicotine can blunt reward.\n- Light/seasonality: low morning light can flatten mood and sleep timing.\n- Health basics: thyroid, iron, B12, vitamin D deficiencies can mimic burnout. Worth a quick PCP check if this persists.\n\n3\u2011minute self\u2011check (helpful signal, not a diagnosis)\n- PHQ\u20112: In the past 2 weeks, have you had (a) little interest/pleasure in doing things; (b) feeling down/hopeless? If either is \u201cmore than half the days,\u201d consider talking to a clinician. Use WHO\u20115 as a well\u2011being check if you prefer.\n\n10\u2011day reboot (minimal willpower, high\u2011yield)\n- Morning anchor (daily): fixed wake time + 20\u201330 min outside light and easy movement (walk/jog, no pace target). This helps both mood and the 3:30 wake.\n- Pleasure + mastery: schedule 1 small \u201cfeels good\u201d block (15\u201330 min) and 1 \u201cmeaningful/finishable\u201d task (45\u201390 min) each day. Action precedes motivation.\n- Celebrate wins on purpose: after any milestone, do a 3\u2011minute savor\u2014write 3 specifics that went well and share one with someone. Train your brain to register the \u201creceipt\u201d as a reward.\n- Social micro\u2011dose: 2 short, intentional connections this week (walk with a friend, call a sibling). Social reward is a strong antidote to flatness.\n- Digital and stimulants: caffeine cutoff by late morning; alcohol 0\u20131 drinks and not near bedtime; dim screens 2 hours before bed.\n- Sleep maintenance: if you wake at 3:30, use the get\u2011out\u2011of\u2011bed, dim\u2011light, boring\u2011activity loop until sleepy; avoid clock\u2011watching.\n- Novelty/meaning: add one tiny new thing (different route, new lunch spot, 30 minutes on a dormant interest). Novelty re\u2011primes reward.\n\nIf you want a guided nudge\n- I can draft a 10\u2011day checklist you can drop on your calendar and a simple \u201cwin\u2011savor\u201d template for deals and workouts.\n\nWhen to get extra support\n- If the flatness/irritability persists >2\u20133 weeks, or worsens, book a visit with a PCP/therapist. Ask about sleep, mood, and basic labs (TSH, CBC/iron, B12, vitamin D). CBT\u2011I can help the wakeups. If you ever have thoughts of self\u2011harm, call 988 (US) or your local crisis line and seek immediate help.\n\nIf you share your typical schedule, alcohol/caffeine timing, and how many nights this happens, I\u2019ll tailor the 10\u2011day plan around your constraints.",

Turn on Do Not Disturb and grayscale; charge it across the room. Use an old\u2011school alarm if needed.\n- Add gentle company: play a low\u2011stim audio you actually like (mellow audiobook or sleep podcast like Nothing Much Happens, Sleepy, LeVar Burton Reads). Keep the room dim/warm.\n- Give the feelings somewhere to land: 5 minutes of \u201cwhat\u2019s here\u201d journaling, no fixing.

Safari/Chrome \u201cblocklist\u201d at night if you can.\n- If\u2011then plan: If I reach for my phone in bed, then I press play on my pre\u2011queued audiobook and put it face\u2011down.\n- \u201cPanic pause\u201d script when the urge hits: Name the feeling (\u201clonely/antsy\u201d). Ask: Will this help me sleep? Is there anything actionable? Can it wait? Then do 5 breaths.\n\nMake the nights less empty (this week)\n- Sound as company: pick one steady nighttime soundtrack (audiobook, gentle radio, rain sounds). Same thing every night; predictability helps.\n- Reclaim the space: small change with outsized effect\u2014new pillowcase/scented candle/throw, move a lamp, swap photos. Signal \u201cthis is my space now.\u201d\n- Set a 10\u2011minute \u201ccomfort ritual\u201d: warm tea/cocoa, stretch, skincare, pet time, or a hot shower. Keep it identical each night.\n- Bookend check\u2011ins: line up two 10\u2011minute evening calls this week with a friend. Script: \u201cNights are rough post\u2011breakup\u2014can we do a 10\u2011min check\u2011in around 9:45 Tues/Thurs? I\u2019ll return the favor.\u201d\n\nDaytime moves that make nights easier\n- Morning light + movement: outside for 20\u201330 minutes within an hour of waking (walk/jog). Calms the 3:30 wake and steadies mood.\n- \u201cGrief time\u201d earlier in the day (15 minutes): write what hurts and one next step. Contain the processing so less spills into midnight.\n- Social micro\u2011doses: put 2 low\u2011effort plans on the calendar (walk with a friend, lunch, class). Loneliness at night is easier if you\u2019ve had real connection by day.\n- Cut drivers of 3 a.m. wake: no caffeine after late morning; keep alcohol 0\u20131 and not late; dim screens the last 2 hours before bed.\n\nGentle grief rituals (optional, powerful)\n- Unsent letter to your ex (or to yourself 6 months from now). Keep it; don\u2019t send.\n- A small \u201cclosing\u201d act: box shared mementos, rearrange furniture, or introduce one new item you like.

Could we do a quick call around 9:30 one night this week?\u201d\n- Pleasant + mastery: each day, one small thing that feels good (15\u201330 min walk/music/cooking) and one finishable work item (45\u201390 min).\n\nIf eating feels impossible\n- Go liquid/soft: smoothie, protein shake, miso/tomato soup, oatmeal, kefir.\n- Keep a \u201csnack ladder\u201d visible: nuts, trail mix, cheese sticks, jerky, fruit, yogurts. A few bites still count.\n\nWhen to get extra support\n- If this fog/wired swing, low appetite, or sleep trouble persists more than 2 weeks, or worsens, book your PCP or a therapist. Ask about sleep, mood, and quick labs (thyroid, iron, B12, vitamin D). They can speed relief.\n- If you ever feel unsafe or have thoughts of self\u2011harm, call or text 988 (US) or your local crisis line, or go to the nearest ER.\n\nIf you share your wake/bed times, caffeine/alcohol timing, and a typical day tomorrow, I\u2019ll tailor a 3\u2011day reset and a tiny grocery list you can Instacart tonight.",

You can copy\u2011paste:\n  \u201cI\u2019m struggling with sleep, appetite, and low mood. I\u2019ve had passive thoughts about not wanting to wake up, and I wrote a message to my parents that scared me.

Wed 7:30 or Thu 6 ok?\u201d\n- Keep anchors that help: fixed wake time, 20\u201330 minutes of outdoor light within an hour of waking, small meals every 3\u20134 hours, and a simple wind\u2011down. If you wake at night, use your 3 a.m. card: slow breaths, jot worries \u2192 one tiny action for tomorrow, cognitive shuffle; if not sleepy in ~15\u201320 min, dim\u2011light, boring paper activity.\n\nIf you\u2019re willing, tell me:\n- Where you are (country/state) so I can share local crisis resources if needed.\n- Whether you feel safe right now.\n- One person I can help you text for a check\u2011in tonight.\n- Do you want me to turn the letter into a 3\u2011sentence support ask you can send when ready?\n\nYou\u2019re not alone in this, and you\u2019re not a burden.

This can help you feel more confident and in control.\n*   **Practice active listening**: If you're starting to feel overwhelmed or out of your depth, try focusing on listening rather than speaking.\n*   **Be kind to yourself**: If you need to step away, don't worry about it - chat with yourself, take a deep breath, or do what needs to be done so you can get back up or ingest when you feel possible consistent",
