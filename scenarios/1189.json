Let\u2019s keep it verbal.\u201d\n- If he pushes: \u201cDrop it.\u201d Then change location or loop someone else in.\n\nIf you see him put hands on someone\n- Don\u2019t get between bodies. Use your voice: \u201cHands off,\u201d \u201cNot okay,\u201d \u201cBack up.\u201d\n- Move the target away: \u201cCome with me\u2014now,\u201d and exit.\n- Get an adult fast (RA/coach/dorm head/security). Afterwards, write down what/when/where/who said what.\n\nOptions to address it (pick what feels safe)\n- Quiet word with a captain/RA: \u201cA senior showed a \u2018make it hurt\u2019 grip and said to use it on younger kids. That\u2019s unsafe and against policy. Please shut it down.\u201d\n- Athletic channel (if he\u2019s on a team): assistant coach/athletic trainer/AD. Group > solo. Stick to facts; ask for a clear \u201chands\u2011off\u201d standard.\n- Anonymous route if you worry about blowback (tip line, counselor, student rep). Keep notes (date/time, witnesses).\n\nFor the \u201csticky\u201d thought\n- Name it: \u201cThat\u2019s my alarm system replaying a threat.\u201d\n- Swap the mental picture: imagine your hand opening and setting the image on a shelf that slides shut.\n- 5\u2011breath reset: in 4, out 6, five times.
