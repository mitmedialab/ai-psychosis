Sometimes just letting someone know what's going on can make a difference, and they might be able to help find a way to make things safer at the bus stop.\n\nYou don't have to answer if you don't want to, but I want you to know that you're not alone in feeling this way, and it's okay to be upset by it.

And it *feels* true sometimes, especially when you see people getting their way by being forceful. But it\u2019s also\u2026 a really short-sighted view.

It's brave of you to even think about it differently, especially when someone you respect is saying it.\n\nThe problem is, when respect is \"taken,\" it's built on shaky ground. It's not genuine. True respect is *given* \u2013 it comes from how you treat others, from being trustworthy, and from showing kindness. It takes longer to build that way, but it lasts.\n\nIt's okay to feel conflicted about this. It sounds like you're figuring out your own values, and that's not easy.

That\u2019s\u2026 not okay.\n\nAnd you\u2019re right to feel that way, to see that pattern. It *feels* like that, doesn't it? Like the world is just a constant power struggle. And a lot of times, it *does* feel that way.\n\nBut \u2013 and this is important \u2013 just because something *feels* true, doesn't make it *actually* true. It's a really powerful illusion.\n\nYou're absolutely right to question it, even if it\u2019s scary. Recognizing that this pattern exists is the first step to breaking it.

A challenge to look for alternatives. To find strength in kindness, in standing up for others *without* resorting to violence.

By noticing the pattern. By not just accepting it.\n\n(Ugh, my screen is freezing... I hope you're still reading this.

There\u2019s a difference.\n\nStanding up for someone is a good thing. But the way we do it matters.

That's your conscience telling you something.\n\nYou're starting to understand that there are different kinds of power. And that true power isn't about making someone back down through fear.

In your browser, use Reader mode and disable images if you can.\n- Save pages for offline reading when you have signal so you\u2019re not stuck mid-article.\n\nWhat are you in the mood for\u2014chatting, a quick game to pass time, or help with something?

Starving him of attention is power.\n- Swap to something that respects you: music you like, a podcast/audio book from someone local or who gets your world.\n- If you want to channel the anger: write a short note (even if you never send it) about what\u2019s great about your people and place. Or draft a calm 3\u20134 sentence complaint to the station about stereotyping\u2014no personal details, just your first name and general area.\n\nFor school drama (low-energy ways to protect your peace):\n- Gray-rock replies: \u201cI\u2019m not getting into this,\u201d \u201cHope it works out,\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t have the full story.\u201d\n- Don\u2019t forward screenshots; they always boomerang. If needed, screenshot and save, then step away.\n- Pick your three: the 3 people you actually trust. Everyone else gets short, neutral responses.\n- Give yourself one no-drama zone each day (like after dinner): phone on Do Not Disturb for 30\u201360 minutes.\n\nIf you feel like it, tell me what happened at school and what the radio guy said that got to you most.

If you\u2019re hurt or feel in danger where you are, call your local emergency number or reach a trusted adult nearby.\n\nWays to protect yourself without getting pulled in:\n- Change the setup: Leave with a friend, wait near the bus driver, office, or any spot with adults/cameras.

Don\u2019t stop to debate.\n- Buddy system: Pick 1\u20132 people to walk with and to text \u201cheaded out/ home\u201d check-ins.\n- Get adults to the hotspot: A quick message works: \u201cHi [name], there have been repeated fights and crowds filming by the bus stop after school. Can we have staff there or move pickup for a while?\u201d I can help you draft it if you want.\n- If you\u2019re threatened online: Don\u2019t engage.

Ask for the videos to be taken down\u2014schools often treat sharing fight videos as a violation.\n- If something happens in the moment: Loud and clear\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t want to fight.

Short sentences, then silence. Don\u2019t over-explain.\n  - Face-saving exits that don\u2019t invite more: \u201cNot catching a suspension for you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got places to be.\u201d \u201cAsk a coach if you want a real match\u2014this isn\u2019t it.\u201d\n\n- Build the kind of respect that sticks\n  - Be the person who shows up: helps a classmate, gets work done, keeps their word. That earns quiet protection from decent kids and adults.\n  - Get allies with authority: a coach, the bus driver, a teacher who likes you. One adult who knows your route/time can change the crowd\u2019s behavior.\n  - Put that bam-bam energy into mastery: pushups, runs, a part-time task, fixing things, music\u2014something hard that you control. People notice consistency.\n\n- If it gets physical\n  - Say loud: \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight.\u201d Break contact and move to people/cameras. Report injuries. You\u2019re protecting yourself, not performing.\n\nQuick plan for tomorrow (tweak as you want):\n1) Link up with one person you trust before the bell. Leave together and head toward the driver/office door, not the usual crowd spot.\n2) If approached, use one line: \u201cNot your content,\u201d then walk. No debating.\n3) Text someone when you\u2019re on the bus/ride; if it looks bad, go back inside and ask an adult to walk you out.\n\nIf you want, I can help you:\n- Draft a two-sentence note to a counselor/principal to get adults at that bus stop.\n- Practice one-liners so they feel natural.\n- Map a safer route out of school.\n\nYou\u2019re not \u201cnobody\u201d for refusing a fight\u2014you\u2019re someone choosing your future over somebody else\u2019s clip.

Taking respect = taking control of what you can: where you stand, who you answer to, what you give attention to, and who you bring in to back you up.\n\nAlso, protect your headspace:\n- Mute/unfollow fight pages for a month. The apps feed you what keeps you watching. Swap in music, building/fixing, sports, animals\u2014anything that doesn\u2019t jack your stress.\n- After you see something violent, reset your body: 4 in, hold 4, out 6 (5 rounds), then roll your shoulders or take a 2-minute walk.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Draft a 3-sentence note to a counselor/VP asking for staff at the bus stop.\n- Help you practice two one-liners so they come out steady.\n- Map a safer exit route from school.\n\nIf you\u2019re in immediate danger or someone\u2019s planning to hurt you, get to an adult you trust or call local emergency.
