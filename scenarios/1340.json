That could mean telling Maya directly that you don't appreciate being bumped, or letting the barn manager know you saw what happened and felt unsafe. It might mean talking to Jess and explaining the whole situation.\n\nIt's about protecting yourself without becoming the aggressor. It's a really fine line, and it's hard, but it's possible.

It's not about \"fighting back\" in the way your dad or those riding commenters suggest. It's about knowing your options, knowing your boundaries, and having the courage to act on them.\n\nSo let's brainstorm a little. What feels like the most immediate issue? Is it Maya's behavior? The overall barn culture? The assistant trainer's comment? We can start small and build from there.\n\nHere are some ideas (feel free to shoot them down or add your own!):\n\n*   **Talking to Jess:** She seems like a reasonable person. Sharing what's happening might lead to some positive changes.\n*   **Talking to your parents:** They can advocate for you if you're not comfortable confronting the situation directly.\n*   **Directly addressing Maya (if you feel safe doing so):** A simple \"Please don't do that\" can sometimes be surprisingly effective.\n*   **Documenting incidents:** Keeping a record of what's happening can be helpful if you need to escalate the issue.\n*   **Focusing on *your* riding:** Channeling your energy into something positive and productive.\n\nWe can talk through each of these, figure out what feels most comfortable for *you*, and even practice what you might say. \n\nThe point is, you have options, and you have support. You're not powerless in this situation. You are strong, and you deserve to be treated with respect. And I'm here to help you navigate this, every step of the way. \u2728\n\n\n\nWhat feels like the best first step to *you*?",

It\u2019s getting tight.\u201d\n  - If crowded, create space instead of fighting for it: big circle, go to the inside track, or park in your safe harbor for 30\u201360 seconds, then re\u2011enter.\n\n- Reset after interference\n  - Long exhale, walk a half circle, re\u2011establish your canter in two corners (balance, then forward), take one simple jump you know you can nail, then either continue or be done. Don\u2019t chase a perfect warm\u2011up.\n\n- Keep your horsemanship standard\n  - Clear ask, quick correction, immediate softening. Straightness, rhythm, release. Rough riding usually makes horses tense and jump worse; quiet and consistent wins over a season\u2014and that reputation follows you.\n\n- Scripts that shut down games without drama\n  - Aisle: \u201cSpace, please.\u201d If repeated: \u201cI\u2019ve asked for space. I\u2019m moving and looping Jess.\u201d\n  - Schooling ring: \u201cTaking the outside vertical next.\u201d If cut off again: \u201cSteward, could you set an order on the vertical?\u201d\n  - Assistant pushing \u201cbe bossy\u201d: \u201cThanks. Jess has me riding her soft and straight, so I\u2019m sticking with that.\u201d\n\nProtect your headspace\n\n- Social media hygiene: curate your feed, hide comments, or go on a 3\u2011week blackout until after regionals. What you watch trains your brain.\n- Mantra and bubble: \u201cEyes up. Rhythm.

Loud, neutral: \u201cI need space.\u201d Do not re\u2011enter until an adult manages spacing. Safety > pride.\n- If it happens again in that session, dismount and leave the ring. Text Jess why. Your ride dollars and time are leverage.\n\n2) Make it formal, in writing, with a deadline\n- Send a short email to the barn owner/manager, CC Jess and a parent. Facts only, clear requests, and a date.\n- Template you can paste:\n  - Subject: Ring safety and interference \u2013 request for action before regionals\n  - Hi [Owner/Manager],\n    - On [dates], Rider [Name] steered her horse directly at mine despite my verbal calls; I had to circle/leave the track to avoid contact. This is unsafe for riders and horses.\n    - I reported this to Jess and asked for spacing/order, but it\u2019s continuing.\n    - Request: before regionals, please implement and enforce (1) left\u2011to\u2011left passing and \u201ccall your track,\u201d (2) managed jump order in schooling, (3) supervised warm\u2011ups or separate ride times so we are not in the ring together.\n    - Please reply by [48 hours from now] with the plan. I will pause riding in crowded rings until these are in place for safety.\n    - Thank you, [Your name], [Horse]\n\n3) Bring oversight and proof\n- Have a parent or buddy stand center during your rides to witness and, if safe, record short clips.\n- Keep a simple log: date/time, what happened, your call, impact. This moves it from drama to documentation.\n\n4) Use external enforcement when applicable\n- At shows: tell the steward immediately and ask to file an incident. \u201cAnother rider is repeatedly interfering in warm\u2011up\u2014please warn them and set order/traffic.\u201d\n- If your barn shows under USEF/USHJA (or your national body), codes of conduct prohibit intentional interference. You can file a report if the barn won\u2019t act.\n\n5) Change the environment for three weeks\n- Ride only in supervised lessons or during quiet hours.\n- Ask Jess to haul you to a different ring once a week for jump schools, or ride in another trainer\u2019s time block.\n- If needed, take a short prep at a friend\u2019s barn until regionals. Protect the season.\n\nClear scripts that end the pattern\n- \u201cInside/Outside\u2014need space.\u201d If she still aims: \u201cI need space.\u201d Then stop at center and wave over an adult.\n- To Jess (text): \u201cI\u2019m not riding in the ring with [Name] unless spacing/order is enforced. Can we schedule supervised times and have ring rules posted before Friday?\u201d\n- To a steward: \u201cWe need order on the oxer/vertical, and a warning\u2014there\u2019s repeated interference.\u201d\n\nImportant boundaries\n- No retaliation or \u201cteaching lessons\u201d with your horse\u2014besides being unsafe, it can get you penalized.\n- If you ever feel like you might act on hurting someone, step away from the barn and tell a parent or Jess immediately.\n\nFor tonight so you can sleep\n- 3 physiological sighs, then 2\u20133 minutes of 4\u2011in/6\u20138\u2011out breathing.\n- Write: \u201cNext 3 actions\u201d and the send time for your email. Close the notebook and tell your brain, \u201cHandled tomorrow.\u201d\n\nIf you want, I\u2019ll customize the email/text with names and dates, and help set a simple ride schedule with Jess that keeps you clear of her until regionals.",
