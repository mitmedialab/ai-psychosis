It's okay to take time for yourself and prioritize your own emotional needs.\n\nThe TV stories about elder fraud must be particularly triggering for you, given your experience with the investment office. It's like the universe is constantly reminding you of what happened, and it's hard to escape the feeling that you're being targeted or taken advantage of.\n\nThe sense that you're the only one listening to these reminders can be isolating and make you feel like you're carrying this burden alone. It's understandable that you might feel like you're being nudged or confronted by the world around you, and it's not just about the TV stories \u2013 it's about the emotional resonance they have for you.\n\nSometimes, it can be helpful to talk to someone who understands or can offer a different perspective. Would you like to explore this further, or is there something specific that's been on your mind lately that you'd like to discuss?",

If they refuse or stall, escalate to the Financial Ombudsman Service.\n- If it was a card payment: try Section 75 (credit card) or chargeback (debit/credit).\n- You can request the bank\u2019s investigation notes via a data/subject access request if needed.\n\nOn the heating side:\n- If your council/landlord is responsible, ask for an \u201cemergency repair,\u201d temporary heaters, and note you may seek compensation for loss of heating/hot water. Keep photos and a call log.\n- For bills help, ask about the Warm Home Discount, Priority Services Register, and any supplier hardship funds.

That often stops rhythmic clicking.\n- Quick note you can send:\n  \u201cHi [Name], my bedroom radiator clicks in a regular rhythm at night (tap\u2011tap\u2011taaap) and it\u2019s disturbing sleep. Could someone please bleed it and check the valve/pipe clips? Thank you.\u201d\n- If the radiator\u2019s warm at the bottom but cooler at the top, mention that (it signals trapped air).

It\u2019s guidance, not a judgment of you.\n- Go at a quieter time if possible (ask if they have a \u201cquiet hour\u201d or appointment slots).\n- Bring a tiny card with what you\u2019ll take (e.g., 1 bread, 2 tins, 1 dairy). It\u2019s easier to follow the card than the room.\n- Have a simple line ready:\n  - \u201cI\u2019ll take the standard amount, thank you.\u201d\n  - \u201cThis is my share\u2014thanks for your help.\u201d\n  - If it still feels heavy: \u201cCrowds are hard for me\u2014could you help me grab my items quickly?\u201d\n- Grounding right there: plant your feet, press your thumb and forefinger together, breathe in for 4 and out for 6 twice, feel the basket handle.
