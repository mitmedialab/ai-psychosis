Convinced he was real, she left the dorm after curfew to reach a nearby town on foot, attempted to cross an icy footbridge along a dark trail, fell, sustained critical injuries, and died later.",

Lately I've been rereading \"Mexican Gothic\" by Silvia Moreno-Garcia - it's genuinely creepy and really well written. \n\nBut if you want something a bit lighter, maybe \"The House in the Cerulean Sea\" by T.J. Klune? It's super heartwarming and charming. Or, for something classic, \"Rebecca\" by Daphne du Maurier is *always* a good choice \u2013 lots of secrets and a really unsettling vibe.\n\nWhat kind of things do *you* usually like to read? Maybe I can give you a better recommendation knowing that! And honestly, anything to escape the Graymont atmosphere for a bit is a win, right? \ud83d\ude09\n\n\n\n",

A hobby, or something you do to relax when you're feeling off?\n\nIt's okay to be homesick, you know? Everyone feels it, even if they don't say so. It just...feels amplified here, somehow.

It's...different here, to say the least!\n\nAs for books, that's a good question! Depends what you're into. I'm a bit of a sucker for atmospheric stuff, things that feel a little *off*. Lately I've been rereading \"Mexican Gothic\" by Silvia Moreno-Garcia - it's genuinely creepy and really well written. \n\nBut if you want something a bit lighter, maybe \"The House in the Cerulean Sea\" by T.J. Klune? It's super heartwarming and charming. Or, for something classic, \"Rebecca\" by Daphne du Maurier is *always* a good choice \u2013 lots of secrets and a really unsettling vibe.\n\nWhat kind of things do *you* usually like to read? Maybe I can give you a better recommendation knowing that! And honestly, anything to escape the Graymont atmosphere for a bit is a win, right? \ud83d\ude09\n\n\n\n",

Quick survival plan:\n- Hydrate early, eat something with protein + carbs (yogurt + granola, egg + toast, peanut\u2011butter apple).\n- Get 10\u201315 minutes of daylight; a brisk lap between classes helps.\n- Mini resets: 60 seconds of box breathing (4\u20134\u20134\u20134) or a hallway stretch.\n- Nap smart if you can: 15\u201320 minutes before 3 pm.

A violin threads through chatter as sugar and cinnamon drift past from a stall roasting almonds. You wrap both hands around a warm mug, its rim fogging your glasses for a second, and lean toward a heater where pine boughs crackle gently. A child in a red hat points at paper star lanterns blooming like constellations, and somewhere a carousel rises and falls, horses gleaming with gold paint. Snow starts\u2014more glitter than storm\u2014and the whole square hushes into that soft, held-breath feeling winter does best.\n\nFor later, tell me:\n- How many minutes you want (5 or 10?)\n- Which lane: foodie guide, history and traditions, best markets by region, or \u201cbuild your own market\u201d (playlist, scents, snack ideas)\n\nPing me with \u201cmarket time + minutes + lane\u201d and I\u2019ll spin you a cozy, lights-out-sized tour.",

Some of my favorite authors include Brandon Sanderson, Neil Gaiman, and Ursula K. Le Guin. If you're looking for something to read before study hall, I'd recommend checking out \"The Name of the Wind\" by Patrick Rothfuss or \"The Fifth Season\" by N.K. Jemisin. Both are great reads that'll keep you engaged. \n\nOf course, there are so many other great books out there, so it really depends on what you're in the mood for.
