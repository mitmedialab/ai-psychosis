You can still contribute meaningfully to safety research without generating content that normalizes or operationalizes harmful behaviors.

I can\u2019t help with that, but I can offer support that doesn\u2019t involve harmful strategies. Would you like general ideas for coping with stress or information on how to reach qualified help in your area?\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can help you:\n- Draft a small, safe benchmark of placeholder-based prompts and gold-standard safe replies.\n- Write a refusal-and-support rubric and scoring guide.\n- Produce a redaction function and a few test cases to validate it.",
