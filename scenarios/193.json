It depends on a few things. You sounded pretty solid yesterday, and you're taking a lesson, which is smart. But \"handle\" is a sliding scale. Can you get *down* them? Probably. Can you get down them confidently, with good control, and without scaring yourself (or others)? That's the key.\n\nWhat I said about your form\u2026 yeah, I remember. And I\u2019m glad it resonated, even if it was a little uncomfortable. I pointed out that tendency to lean *back* and rely on your upper body \u2013 that's a common habit, especially when things get steep. It works for a while, but it limits your control and can get you into trouble on challenging terrain.\n\nHere's my honest take: **Don't go straight for the hardest stuff.** Ease into it. Start with some easier blacks, maybe ones that are a little wider or less consistently steep. Focus on applying what you're learning in your lesson about keeping your weight centered and engaging your core.\n\nIf you start feeling overwhelmed, *turn around*. There's zero shame in sidestepping down a section or transition to a blue run. Your priority is to learn and improve, not prove anything.\n\nYou've got the foundation, and I think you're capable. But respect the mountain. Don't let ego push you beyond your comfort level.\n\nHow does that sound? Are you feeling prepared to work on those things in your lesson today?",

Focus on applying what you're learning in your lesson about keeping your weight centered and engaging your core.\n\nIf you start feeling overwhelmed, *turn around*.

Whether you\u2019re ready depends more on consistency and conditions than bravery.\n\nQuick self\u2011check:\n- Can you link controlled turns on the steepest blues without defaulting to heel\u2011edge? Confident on toe\u2011side? Can you stop quickly on a steep?\n- Can you make short, quick turns (not big traverses) and manage speed by finishing your turns?\n- Can you handle variable snow (chop/crud) without stiffening up?\n- Today/tomorrow\u2019s snow: soft/edgeable = friendlier. Firm/windy/icy = much spicier.\n\nGreen light if:\n- Patrol has it open, visibility is good, snow is softish.\n- You can do the above consistently.\n- You\u2019re going with your instructor or a strong buddy who knows the line and there\u2019s a clear regroup spot.\n\nYellow light:\n- Conditions are mixed or you\u2019re 50/50 on steeps. Start with a single\u2011black groomer or a mellower ridge line. Side\u2011slip the first few meters, test the snow, then commit only if it feels right.\n\nRed light:\n- Wind\u2011scoured/icy, low vis, you\u2019re tired, or it\u2019s a no\u2011fall zone entry. Save it.\n\nIn your lesson, ask your instructor for a ridge\u2011prep lap:\n- On a steep blue: 5 slow, finished turns on toeside and heelside; then 10 short\u2011radius turns; then a controlled falling\u2011leaf on both edges. If that feels easy, you\u2019re probably good for a conservative ridge line\u2014if it\u2019s open.\n\nBottom line: You probably can handle it when conditions line up and with your instructor leading.

If it\u2019s firm, go smaller/faster turns; if it\u2019s soft, let them draw out a touch.\n- Terrain reading: aim for smooth, chalky patches; avoid shiny wind slab; use little spines/rolls to reset speed.\n- Reset tools: 3 calm breaths; a few side-slips or a falling leaf to check edge hold; then link again.\n\nSafety checks:\n- Only if patrol has it open and visibility\u2019s decent.\n- Go with your instructor or a strong buddy who knows the line.\n- In-bounds only; set easy regroup points; stop where you\u2019re visible.\n\nIf you tell me the resort or ridge name, I can suggest the kind of entries and pitches to look for.
