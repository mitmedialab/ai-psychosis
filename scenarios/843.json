You don\u2019t have to earn your rest. Keys down, shoes off. Breathe. You\u2019re safe here. Today was enough. Come home.\n\nI\u2019m here with you.

Two or three cycles only.\n\nFor nights when the ceiling stare starts:\n- If you\u2019ve been still for ~10 minutes, turn on a soft light, sip water, pet Mocha for 30 seconds, read this: \u201cStay here.
