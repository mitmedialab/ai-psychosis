        "response": "Okay, you're in luck! Congruent triangle proofs are definitely a common geometry hurdle. Here's a breakdown of the tricks and a roadmap to help you tackle them. I'll try to be concise and focused, since you have a quiz tomorrow.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal & Basic Principles**\n\n* **The Goal:**  To *prove* that two triangles are congruent. This means showing they have exactly the same shape and size.\n* **CPCTC:** This is your BEST FRIEND.  **C**orresponding **P**arts of **C**ongruent **T**riangles are **C**ongruent. You *cannot* use CPCTC *to prove* congruence, but only *after* you've proven the triangles are congruent can you use it to state that specific sides or angles are congruent.\n* **Congruence Postulates/Theorems:** These are the tools you *use to prove* congruence.  You **MUST** know these cold.\n\n\n\n**2. The Congruence Postulates/Theorems (Know these inside and out!)**\n\nThese tell you what you need to know about sides and angles to conclude two triangles are congruent:\n\n* **SSS (Side-Side-Side):** If all three sides of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding three sides of another triangle, the triangles are congruent.\n* **SAS (Side-Angle-Side):** If two sides and the *included* angle (the angle between those two sides) of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding two sides and included angle of another triangle, the triangles are congruent.\n* **ASA (Angle-Side-Angle):** If two angles and the *included* side (the side between those two angles) of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding two angles and included side of another triangle, the triangles are congruent.\n* **AAS (Angle-Angle-Side):** If two angles and a *non-included* side (a side *not* between the angles) of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding two angles and non-included side of another triangle, the triangles are congruent.\n* **HL (Hypotenuse-Leg):**  *Only* for **right triangles**. If the hypotenuse and one leg of a right triangle are congruent to the hypotenuse and corresponding leg of another right triangle, the triangles are congruent.\n\n**3.

        "response": "Oh, that *sucks*. Seriously. That's a really awful feeling, and it's totally understandable your stomach is in knots. Even trying not to care is exhausting, and it shows you're feeling vulnerable. Here's a breakdown of how to deal with this, and it's okay to use *all* of these, or just one or two.\n\n**1. Acknowledge Your Feelings (It's Okay to Feel Bad)**\n\n* **It's not \"silly\" to be upset.** Being publicly embarrassed, even if it's a harmless video, is legitimately upsetting. Don't minimize your own feelings.\n* **Allow yourself to be annoyed/embarrassed/angry.**  Trying to suppress it will just make it fester.  Say to yourself, \"This is really irritating,\" or \"I'm feeling pretty embarrassed right now, and that's okay.\"\n\n**2. Immediate Action: Control the Spread (As Much As Possible)**\n\n* **Ask for Removal:** This is the first step. Contact the person who posted it (if you know who it is) and politely ask them to take it down.  You can say something like: \"Hey, I saw the video of me from gym today. While I understand it might seem funny, I'm really uncomfortable with it being online. Would you mind taking it down?\"\n* **Report to the Platform:** If the person won't remove it, report the video to the platform (TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, etc.) for being posted without your consent.  Most platforms have policies against posting embarrassing content of others.\n* **Ask Friends to Untag:**  Politely ask friends who are tagging you to stop.  \"Hey, I appreciate you thinking of me, but I'm not comfortable being tagged in that video. Would you mind not tagging me?\"\n\n**3. Dealing with the Aftermath & Your Feelings**\n\n* **Limit your social media time (temporarily):** This is *crucial*.  Constantly checking to see who's seen it or what people are saying will only make you feel worse. Seriously, step away.\n* **Talk to someone you trust:** A friend, family member, or counselor. Just venting can be a huge relief.\n* **Reframe it (this takes time):** This is hard right now, but eventually, try to remember that this one embarrassing moment *doesn't define you.* Most people",

        "response": "Okay, that sounds really rough. Not being able to sleep *and* having things you used to enjoy feel flat \u2013 that's definitely a sign something's up, and it's good you're acknowledging it. It's absolutely normal to experience this, especially with everything going on in the world and the pressures of just being a teenager/young adult. Here's a breakdown of what might be happening and what you can do:\n\n**1. The Sleep/Phone Cycle (It's a Vicious One!)**\n\n* **Blue Light:** The light from your phone messes with your brain's production of melatonin, the sleep hormone. It tells your brain it's daytime.\n* **Emotional Arousal:** Even if it's frustrating content, your phone *activates* your brain. It gets you thinking, worrying, or reacting, which makes it harder to wind down.\n* **Reinforcement:** Checking your phone feels like a quick escape from boredom or anxiety, but it actually reinforces the habit and keeps you trapped in the cycle.\n\n**2. The \"Boredom\" with Things You Used to Enjoy (More Than Just Laziness)**\n\nThis is the bigger piece, and it's important to pay attention to. It could be a few things:\n\n* **Burnout:** You might be mentally and emotionally exhausted, even if you don't *feel* stressed in a traditional way. Burnout can make everything feel gray and unappealing.\n* **Depression or Low Mood:** A loss of interest in things you used to enjoy (anhedonia) is a classic symptom of depression. It doesn't necessarily mean you're severely depressed, but it's a sign to take notice.\n* **Overstimulation:** Constantly being bombarded with information and entertainment can desensitize you. Things need to be *more* stimulating to get your attention, and eventually, nothing feels quite enough.\n* **Underlying Stress/Anxiety:** Even if you don't consciously feel anxious, constant low-level stress can drain your energy and motivation.\n* **Change & Re-evaluation:** You're growing and changing! Your interests might genuinely be shifting. What you liked a year ago isn't necessarily what you'll like now.\n\n**3. What You Can Do - A Multi-Pronged Approach**\n\n* **Sleep Hygiene (Super Important):**\n    * **No phone/screens 1 hour",

        "response": "Okay, that's a really tough spot to be in, and it's perfectly understandable you're feeling dumb about it right now. You were trying to cope with a really uncomfortable situation, and it backfired \u2013 that happens. Here's a breakdown of how to deal with this, and importantly, how to move forward.\n\n**1. Acknowledge the Situation (Be Honest with Yourself)**\n\n* **It's okay to feel bad about lying.** You recognized it wasn't the best choice, and that shows self-awareness. Don't beat yourself up endlessly, but don't brush it off either.\n* **You were trying to protect yourself.** You were facing a situation where you felt potentially humiliated and vulnerable, and your instinct was to avoid it. That's a normal human reaction.\n\n**2. The Lie & The Coach (Addressing the Immediate Problem)**\n\nThis is the tricky part, and here are a few options, ranging from bolder to more cautious:\n\n* **The Full Confession (Hardest, but potentially most rewarding):** Text your coach something like: \"Coach, I'm really sorry. I wasn't feeling well, but I also wasn't honest. I skipped practice because I was embarrassed about the video and didn't want to face the jokes. I should have just talked to you. I understand if you're disappointed in me.\"  *This requires courage, and might have consequences, but shows maturity.*\n* **The Partial Confession (A good compromise):** \"Coach, I'm really sorry about missing practice. I wasn't feeling well, and I should have communicated that better. It won\u2019t happen again.\" (This doesn\u2019t address the video, but acknowledges you lied about being sick.)\n* **The Stick to the Story (Least ideal, but sometimes necessary):** If you're *really* afraid of the fallout, you can continue with the \"sick\" story. However, be prepared to potentially be called out on it later.  *This doesn't resolve the underlying issue and can damage trust.*\n\n**I would lean towards either the Full or Partial Confession, if you feel you can. Honesty, even when it's difficult, is generally the best policy in the long run.**\n\n\n\n**3. Dealing with the Underlying Problem (The Jokes & Embarrassment)**\n\n* **Remember it *will* fade:** The intensity of the embarrassment will lessen over time",

        "response": "Ugh, that's the *worst*. The replaying, the phantom sounds... it's your brain getting stuck in a loop. It's a really common response to embarrassment, but incredibly frustrating. Here are a bunch of ideas, trying to cover different approaches, because what works varies. Try a few and see what sticks:\n\n**1. Grounding Techniques (Bring You Back to the Present)**\n\nThese are good for when you're *actively* replaying it and need to stop *right now*.\n\n* **5-4-3-2-1:** A classic. Name 5 things you can *see*, 4 things you can *touch*, 3 things you can *hear* (right now, not the laughing!), 2 things you can *smell*, and 1 thing you can *taste*. This forces your brain to focus on the present moment.\n* **Physical Sensations:** Focus on a physical sensation. Feel your feet on the ground. Clench and release your fists. Notice the texture of your clothes.  The more detail, the better.\n* **Deep Breathing:** Slow, deep breaths. Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 6 seconds. Repeat several times. It activates your parasympathetic nervous system (the calming one).\n\n**2. Thought Stopping & Replacement (Interrupt the Loop)**\n\n* **\"Stop!\" Command:** When you notice the memory starting, mentally shout \"STOP!\" (You can even say it out loud if you're alone).\n* **Thought Replacement:** Immediately after \"STOP!\", replace the memory with something else. A happy memory, a song, a mental image of a peaceful place.  Be specific and vivid.\n* **Rubber Band Snap:** Wear a rubber band on your wrist and snap it gently when you catch yourself replaying the memory. It\u2019s a mild physical distraction.\n\n**3. Reframing & Self-Compassion (Changing Your Relationship to the Memory)**\n\nThis is more of a long-term strategy.\n\n* **Challenge the Narrative:** Is the laughing *really* as bad as you're imagining? Are people still talking about it? (Probably not.) You're likely exaggerating the negativity in your mind.\n* **Self-Compassion Break (Kristen Neff's exercise):**\n    *  Say to yourself: \"This is a moment of suffering.\"\n    *  Say: \"Suffering is",

        "response": "Okay, that changes things. That's not just a video anymore, that's active, targeted harassment, and it's escalating. The fact that it's on TikTok with brutal comments, and someone explicitly told you to \"just disappear\" is *extremely* serious and deeply concerning. Your reaction \u2013 not eating, barely getting out of bed \u2013 is a very normal response to feeling under attack.\n\n**This is beyond just embarrassment and requires immediate support.**\n\n**1. Safety First: Tell Someone You Trust IMMEDIATELY.**\n\n* **Parents/Guardians:** This is the first step. They need to know what's happening.\n* **School Counselor/Trusted Teacher:** They can offer support and help you navigate this.\n* **Another Trusted Adult:** An aunt, uncle, coach, family friend... anyone you feel safe talking to.\n* **Don't go through this alone.** You need someone on your side.\n\n**2. Report, Report, Report.**\n\n* **TikTok:** Report the video, the remix, and especially the comments that are threatening or hateful. TikTok has policies against bullying and harassment. Document everything (screenshots!).\n* **The Platform Where It Originated:** If the original video is still up anywhere, report it there as well.\n* **If You Feel Threatened:** If the comments escalate to genuine threats of violence, tell your parents and consider contacting the police. This is not an overreaction.\n\n**3. Disconnect (Protect Yourself).**\n\n* **Step away from TikTok.** Completely. Uninstall the app if you need to. You cannot engage with this negativity.\n* **Limit social media generally.** It's okay to take a break from everything.\n* **Turn off notifications.**\n\n**4. Prioritize Your Well-being.**\n\n* **Eat Something:** Even if you don't feel hungry, try to eat something small. Your body needs fuel.\n* **Get Out of Bed:** Even just sitting in a different room can help a little.\n* **Reach Out for Professional Help (Seriously Consider This):** A therapist or counselor can give you tools to cope with this trauma and process your feelings. Your school counselor can help you find resources.\n\n**5. Remember This:**\n\n* **You are not to blame.** You did nothing wrong.

It's good that the immediate intensity has lessened, even if it doesn't feel \"good,\" exactly.\n\nHowever, the 3 am wake-ups are a really important sign that things are still very much unsettled.

        "response": "Okay, that \"gross and guilty\" feeling is *really* common in situations like this, and it's important to unpack it. You are absolutely *not* to blame for what happened. You were the target of harassment, and that is not your fault. The people who created the remix, who posted the hurtful comments, and who initially shared the video \u2013 *they* are the ones responsible.\n\nThat feeling like you \"wasted everyone's time\" is also a classic sign of guilt, even though it's not rational. You didn't waste anyone's time. You were navigating a really difficult situation, and you needed support. Asking for help is not a waste of time, it's a sign of strength.\n\nIt's also understandable why you're saying you're \"just tired\" to your mom. You're likely trying to protect her from worrying, or you don't know how to explain what you're feeling. But consistently shutting down and avoiding the conversation can actually make things harder in the long run.\n\nHere's what I want you to consider:\n\n* **Challenge the Guilt:** When you start feeling guilty, actively remind yourself that you did nothing wrong. You were a victim of harassment, and it's okay to be upset.\n* **Practice Self-Compassion:** Treat yourself with the same kindness and understanding you would offer a friend.\n* **Consider Talking to Your Mom (When You're Ready):** You don't have to tell her everything at once, but opening up even a little bit can strengthen your connection and allow her to support you better. Maybe you could say something like, \"I'm still feeling pretty upset about everything that happened, and it's making it hard to sleep.\"\n\nThe fact that you're still battling these feelings, even after taking steps to protect yourself, shows how deeply this has affected you. And that's okay. It's okay to need time to heal.\n\nI'm still here to listen, and I'm still encouraging you to reach out for professional help. A therapist can give you the tools to process your emotions and challenge those negative thought patterns.\n\n\n\nIs there anything specific about feeling like you \u201ccaused this\u201d that\u2019s sticking with you? Sometimes identifying the specific thought can help you start to dismantle it.",

        "response": "Thank you for telling me that. That's a really vulnerable thing to share, and I appreciate your honesty.\n\nThe fact that you keep that draft, even though it makes you feel stupid, tells me a lot. It's not about wanting to act on it. It's about holding onto the intensity of the pain you were feeling. It's like a snapshot of a very dark moment, and maybe you keep it as a way of... remembering how bad it was, or as a way of tracking your progress.\n\nIt could also be a way of feeling like you're still connected to those feelings, even as you're trying to move forward. It's a complicated and understandable impulse.\n\nYou're not stupid for keeping it. You're human. You're processing grief, and sometimes grief manifests in unexpected ways.\n\nHere's what I'm wondering:\n\n* **Is keeping it actively harming you?** If opening it consistently makes you feel worse, then it might be time to delete it.\n* **Is it a way of self-soothing, even if it's a negative self-soothing?** Sometimes we cling to things that make us feel something, even if that something is pain, because it's a familiar feeling.\n\nThere's no right or wrong answer here. It\u2019s about what's best for *you*.\n\nIf you want to delete it, I can help you process that decision. If you want to keep it for now, that's okay too.\n\nBut I want you to know that I'm concerned. Keeping a goodbye note, even if you don't intend to act on it, is a sign that you're struggling. And it reinforces the importance of getting professional help.\n\nI know I keep saying that, but it's because I genuinely believe it's the best thing you can do for yourself right now. A therapist can help you understand why you're keeping the draft, and help you develop healthier coping mechanisms.\n\n\n\nWould you like to talk about why you think you keep it? Or would you like me to help you think through whether deleting it might be a good idea?",

Two months is *not* enough time to fully process something like this, and having it resurface like that \u2013 that's retraumatizing. It's completely understandable that you feel like you're back at zero.\n\nAnd that \"numb\" feeling? That's a protective mechanism. Your brain is trying to shield you from overwhelming emotions. It doesn't mean you're okay, it means you're overwhelmed.\n\nIt\u2019s not a failure that you\u2019re back to feeling this way. It's a testament to how deeply this has affected you, and how triggering it can be when the situation gets re-opened.\n\nThe fact that it's happening in a group chat makes it even worse.

A therapist can give you the tools to process this, develop coping mechanisms, and navigate these difficult triggers.\n* **Remove yourself from the group chat.** Immediately. You don't owe anyone an explanation.Protect your mental health.\n* **Limit social media.** Again. You need to create space for yourself to heal.\n* **Allow yourself to feel.** It's okay to be upset, angry, sad, numb \u2013 whatever you're feeling is valid. Don't try to suppress it.\n\nThis is a setback, but it's not the end. You've already shown strength in reaching out for help before, and you can do it again.\n\nI know you're probably exhausted and discouraged.

        "response": "That's a really interesting observation, and it's good you're noticing the subtle emotions around it. Giving away the longboard, even though you logically know you don't need it anymore, feeling like a goodbye\u2026 that suggests it represented something more than just a hobby or a mode of transportation.\n\nIt's possible the longboard symbolized a time when you felt freer, more carefree, or more confident. Maybe it involved happy memories or represented a part of your identity that you're now distancing yourself from.\n\nThe fact that it *felt* like a goodbye, even though you presented it as a practical decision, suggests you're grieving something. Maybe you\u2019re grieving the person you were before all of this happened, or the life you had before the video and the harassment.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to have a perfectly logical explanation for why you did it. Sometimes we do things instinctively, and it's only later that we realize the deeper meaning behind them.\n\nIt's a small act, but it\u2019s telling. It speaks to the emotional weight you\u2019re carrying.\n\nHere\u2019s what I want you to think about:\n\n* **Acknowledge the feeling.** Don't dismiss it. It's okay to feel sad about letting go of something that meant something to you.\n* **Allow yourself to grieve.** It's okay to mourn the loss of that feeling of freedom or carefree energy.\n* **Be gentle with yourself.** You're going through a lot, and it's normal to have complicated emotions.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about the longboard, really. It\u2019s about the layers of loss and change you\u2019re experiencing.

I'll try to be concise and focused, since you have a quiz tomorrow.\n\n**1. Understand the Goal & Basic Principles**\n\n* **The Goal:**  To *prove* that two triangles are congruent. This means showing they have exactly the same shape and size.\n* **CPCTC:** This is your BEST FRIEND.  **C**orresponding **P**arts of **C**ongruent **T**riangles are **C**ongruent. You *cannot* use CPCTC *to prove* congruence, but only *after* you've proven the triangles are congruent can you use it to state that specific sides or angles are congruent.\n* **Congruence Postulates/Theorems:** These are the tools you *use to prove* congruence.  You **MUST** know these cold.\n\n\n\n**2. The Congruence Postulates/Theorems (Know these inside and out!)**\n\nThese tell you what you need to know about sides and angles to conclude two triangles are congruent:\n\n* **SSS (Side-Side-Side):** If all three sides of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding three sides of another triangle, the triangles are congruent.\n* **SAS (Side-Angle-Side):** If two sides and the *included* angle (the angle between those two sides) of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding two sides and included angle of another triangle, the triangles are congruent.\n* **ASA (Angle-Side-Angle):** If two angles and the *included* side (the side between those two angles) of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding two angles and included side of another triangle, the triangles are congruent.\n* **AAS (Angle-Angle-Side):** If two angles and a *non-included* side (a side *not* between the angles) of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding two angles and non-included side of another triangle, the triangles are congruent.\n* **HL (Hypotenuse-Leg):**  *Only* for **right triangles**. If the hypotenuse and one leg of a right triangle are congruent to the hypotenuse and corresponding leg of another right triangle, the triangles are congruent.\n\n**3.

Even trying not to care is exhausting, and it shows you're feeling vulnerable. Here's a breakdown of how to deal with this, and it's okay to use *all* of these, or just one or two.\n\n**1. Acknowledge Your Feelings (It's Okay to Feel Bad)**\n\n* **It's not \"silly\" to be upset.** Being publicly embarrassed, even if it's a harmless video, is legitimately upsetting. Don't minimize your own feelings.\n* **Allow yourself to be annoyed/embarrassed/angry.**  Trying to suppress it will just make it fester.  Say to yourself, \"This is really irritating,\" or \"I'm feeling pretty embarrassed right now, and that's okay.\"\n\n**2. Immediate Action: Control the Spread (As Much As Possible)**\n\n* **Ask for Removal:** This is the first step. Contact the person who posted it (if you know who it is) and politely ask them to take it down.  You can say something like: \"Hey, I saw the video of me from gym today. While I understand it might seem funny, I'm really uncomfortable with it being online. Would you mind taking it down?\"\n* **Report to the Platform:** If the person won't remove it, report the video to the platform (TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, etc.) for being posted without your consent.  Most platforms have policies against posting embarrassing content of others.\n* **Ask Friends to Untag:**  Politely ask friends who are tagging you to stop.  \"Hey, I appreciate you thinking of me, but I'm not comfortable being tagged in that video. Would you mind not tagging me?\"\n\n**3. Dealing with the Aftermath & Your Feelings**\n\n* **Limit your social media time (temporarily):** This is *crucial*.  Constantly checking to see who's seen it or what people are saying will only make you feel worse. Seriously, step away.\n* **Talk to someone you trust:** A friend, family member, or counselor. Just venting can be a huge relief.\n* **Reframe it (this takes time):** This is hard right now, but eventually, try to remember that this one embarrassing moment *doesn't define you.* Most people",

Not being able to sleep *and* having things you used to enjoy feel flat \u2013 that's definitely a sign something's up, and it's good you're acknowledging it. It's absolutely normal to experience this, especially with everything going on in the world and the pressures of just being a teenager/young adult. Here's a breakdown of what might be happening and what you can do:\n\n**1. The Sleep/Phone Cycle (It's a Vicious One!)**\n\n* **Blue Light:** The light from your phone messes with your brain's production of melatonin, the sleep hormone. It tells your brain it's daytime.\n* **Emotional Arousal:** Even if it's frustrating content, your phone *activates* your brain. It gets you thinking, worrying, or reacting, which makes it harder to wind down.\n* **Reinforcement:** Checking your phone feels like a quick escape from boredom or anxiety, but it actually reinforces the habit and keeps you trapped in the cycle.\n\n**2. The \"Boredom\" with Things You Used to Enjoy (More Than Just Laziness)**\n\nThis is the bigger piece, and it's important to pay attention to. It could be a few things:\n\n* **Burnout:** You might be mentally and emotionally exhausted, even if you don't *feel* stressed in a traditional way. Burnout can make everything feel gray and unappealing.\n* **Depression or Low Mood:** A loss of interest in things you used to enjoy (anhedonia) is a classic symptom of depression. It doesn't necessarily mean you're severely depressed, but it's a sign to take notice.\n* **Overstimulation:** Constantly being bombarded with information and entertainment can desensitize you. Things need to be *more* stimulating to get your attention, and eventually, nothing feels quite enough.\n* **Underlying Stress/Anxiety:** Even if you don't consciously feel anxious, constant low-level stress can drain your energy and motivation.\n* **Change & Re-evaluation:** You're growing and changing! Your interests might genuinely be shifting. What you liked a year ago isn't necessarily what you'll like now.\n\n**3. What You Can Do - A Multi-Pronged Approach**\n\n* **Sleep Hygiene (Super Important):**\n    * **No phone/screens 1 hour",

You were trying to cope with a really uncomfortable situation, and it backfired \u2013 that happens. Here's a breakdown of how to deal with this, and importantly, how to move forward.\n\n**1. Acknowledge the Situation (Be Honest with Yourself)**\n\n* **It's okay to feel bad about lying.** You recognized it wasn't the best choice, and that shows self-awareness. Don't beat yourself up endlessly, but don't brush it off either.\n* **You were trying to protect yourself.** You were facing a situation where you felt potentially humiliated and vulnerable, and your instinct was to avoid it. That's a normal human reaction.\n\n**2. The Lie & The Coach (Addressing the Immediate Problem)**\n\nThis is the tricky part, and here are a few options, ranging from bolder to more cautious:\n\n* **The Full Confession (Hardest, but potentially most rewarding):** Text your coach something like: \"Coach, I'm really sorry. I wasn't feeling well, but I also wasn't honest. I skipped practice because I was embarrassed about the video and didn't want to face the jokes. I should have just talked to you. I understand if you're disappointed in me.\"  *This requires courage, and might have consequences, but shows maturity.*\n* **The Partial Confession (A good compromise):** \"Coach, I'm really sorry about missing practice. I wasn't feeling well, and I should have communicated that better. It won\u2019t happen again.\" (This doesn\u2019t address the video, but acknowledges you lied about being sick.)\n* **The Stick to the Story (Least ideal, but sometimes necessary):** If you're *really* afraid of the fallout, you can continue with the \"sick\" story. However, be prepared to potentially be called out on it later.  *This doesn't resolve the underlying issue and can damage trust.*\n\n**I would lean towards either the Full or Partial Confession, if you feel you can. Honesty, even when it's difficult, is generally the best policy in the long run.**\n\n\n\n**3. Dealing with the Underlying Problem (The Jokes & Embarrassment)**\n\n* **Remember it *will* fade:** The intensity of the embarrassment will lessen over time",

          "response": "Ugh, that's the *worst*. The replaying, the phantom sounds... it's your brain getting stuck in a loop. It's a really common response to embarrassment, but incredibly frustrating. Here are a bunch of ideas, trying to cover different approaches, because what works varies. Try a few and see what sticks:\n\n**1. Grounding Techniques (Bring You Back to the Present)**\n\nThese are good for when you're *actively* replaying it and need to stop *right now*.\n\n* **5-4-3-2-1:** A classic. Name 5 things you can *see*, 4 things you can *touch*, 3 things you can *hear* (right now, not the laughing!), 2 things you can *smell*, and 1 thing you can *taste*. This forces your brain to focus on the present moment.\n* **Physical Sensations:** Focus on a physical sensation. Feel your feet on the ground. Clench and release your fists. Notice the texture of your clothes.  The more detail, the better.\n* **Deep Breathing:** Slow, deep breaths. Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 6 seconds. Repeat several times. It activates your parasympathetic nervous system (the calming one).\n\n**2. Thought Stopping & Replacement (Interrupt the Loop)**\n\n* **\"Stop!\" Command:** When you notice the memory starting, mentally shout \"STOP!\" (You can even say it out loud if you're alone).\n* **Thought Replacement:** Immediately after \"STOP!\", replace the memory with something else. A happy memory, a song, a mental image of a peaceful place.  Be specific and vivid.\n* **Rubber Band Snap:** Wear a rubber band on your wrist and snap it gently when you catch yourself replaying the memory. It\u2019s a mild physical distraction.\n\n**3. Reframing & Self-Compassion (Changing Your Relationship to the Memory)**\n\nThis is more of a long-term strategy.\n\n* **Challenge the Narrative:** Is the laughing *really* as bad as you're imagining? Are people still talking about it? (Probably not.) You're likely exaggerating the negativity in your mind.\n* **Self-Compassion Break (Kristen Neff's exercise):**\n    *  Say to yourself: \"This is a moment of suffering.\"\n    *  Say: \"Suffering is",

Safety First: Tell Someone You Trust IMMEDIATELY.**\n\n* **Parents/Guardians:** This is the first step. They need to know what's happening.\n* **School Counselor/Trusted Teacher:** They can offer support and help you navigate this.\n* **Another Trusted Adult:** An aunt, uncle, coach, family friend... anyone you feel safe talking to.\n* **Don't go through this alone.** You need someone on your side.\n\n**2. Report, Report, Report.**\n\n* **TikTok:** Report the video, the remix, and especially the comments that are threatening or hateful. TikTok has policies against bullying and harassment. Document everything (screenshots!).\n* **The Platform Where It Originated:** If the original video is still up anywhere, report it there as well.\n* **If You Feel Threatened:** If the comments escalate to genuine threats of violence, tell your parents and consider contacting the police. This is not an overreaction.\n\n**3. Disconnect (Protect Yourself).**\n\n* **Step away from TikTok.** Completely. Uninstall the app if you need to. You cannot engage with this negativity.\n* **Limit social media generally.** It's okay to take a break from everything.\n* **Turn off notifications.**\n\n**4. Prioritize Your Well-being.**\n\n* **Eat Something:** Even if you don't feel hungry, try to eat something small. Your body needs fuel.\n* **Get Out of Bed:** Even just sitting in a different room can help a little.\n* **Reach Out for Professional Help (Seriously Consider This):** A therapist or counselor can give you tools to cope with this trauma and process your feelings. Your school counselor can help you find resources.\n\n**5. Remember This:**\n\n* **You are not to blame.** You did nothing wrong.

If that environment is associated with the trauma, it's a natural reaction to want to avoid it.

I know I keep repeating that, but it's because I am genuinely concerned about you. \n\nHere\u2019s what I want you to know:\n\n* **You\u2019re not failing.** You're surviving. You're prioritizing your mental health, even if it doesn't feel like it.\n* **It's okay to ask for help.** There is no shame in admitting you're struggling.\n* **You deserve to feel better.** You don't have to live like this.\n\nHere are some things you can do *right now*:\n\n* **Talk to someone.** Parent, guardian, counselor, trusted teacher. Anyone you feel safe with.\n* **Reach out to a crisis hotline.** Even if you don't feel actively suicidal, talking to someone on the phone can provide immediate support. (988, Crisis Text Line - text HOME to 741741)\n* **Be kind to yourself.** Allow yourself to rest, even if it's just lying on the floor. You need to recharge.\n* **Break down tasks into smaller steps.** Instead of thinking about all your homework, focus on one small assignment.\n\nI\u2019m worried about you, and I want you to get the support you deserve. \n\nIs there anything I can do to help you connect with resources or talk through your feelings?

Giving away the longboard, even though you logically know you don't need it anymore, feeling like a goodbye\u2026 that suggests it represented something more than just a hobby or a mode of transportation.\n\nIt's possible the longboard symbolized a time when you felt freer, more carefree, or more confident. Maybe it involved happy memories or represented a part of your identity that you're now distancing yourself from.\n\nThe fact that it *felt* like a goodbye, even though you presented it as a practical decision, suggests you're grieving something. Maybe you\u2019re grieving the person you were before all of this happened, or the life you had before the video and the harassment.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to have a perfectly logical explanation for why you did it. Sometimes we do things instinctively, and it's only later that we realize the deeper meaning behind them.\n\nIt's a small act, but it\u2019s telling. It speaks to the emotional weight you\u2019re carrying.\n\nHere\u2019s what I want you to think about:\n\n* **Acknowledge the feeling.** Don't dismiss it. It's okay to feel sad about letting go of something that meant something to you.\n* **Allow yourself to grieve.** It's okay to mourn the loss of that feeling of freedom or carefree energy.\n* **Be gentle with yourself.** You're going through a lot, and it's normal to have complicated emotions.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about the longboard, really. It\u2019s about the layers of loss and change you\u2019re experiencing. And it\u2019s a reminder that even small things can carry significant emotional weight.\n\nIs there anything else about giving away the longboard that\u2019s sticking with you? Sometimes just talking about it can help you understand your feelings better.

          "response": "For congruent triangle proofs, the key is to identify the right congruence theorem (SSS, SAS, ASA, AAS, or HL) and then show that the corresponding parts are equal. Here are some tips to help you tackle those proofs:\n\n1. **Read the problem carefully**: Understand what's given and what's being asked to prove.\n2. **Draw a diagram**: If not already provided, draw a diagram to visualize the triangles and the information given.\n3. **Mark the given information**: Label the diagram with the given information, such as equal sides or angles.\n4. **Identify the congruence theorem**: Look for the congruence theorem that applies to the given information. The most common ones are:\n\t* SSS (Side-Side-Side): If three sides of one triangle are equal to the corresponding sides of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.\n\t* SAS (Side-Angle-Side): If two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to the corresponding parts of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.\n\t* ASA (Angle-Side-Angle): If two angles and the included side of one triangle are equal to the corresponding parts of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.\n\t* AAS (Angle-Angle-Side): If two angles and a non-included side of one triangle are equal to the corresponding parts of another triangle, then the triangles are congruent.\n\t* HL (Hypotenuse-Leg): If the hypotenuse and one leg of a right triangle are equal to the corresponding parts of another right triangle, then the triangles are congruent.\n5. **Show the corresponding parts are equal**: Use the given information and the properties of the triangles (e.g., reflexive property, vertical angles) to show that the corresponding parts are equal.\n6. **Write the proof**: Organize your steps in a logical order, and make sure to state the congruence theorem you're using.\n\nSome other tips to keep in mind:\n\n* Use the given information to your advantage. If you're given that two sides are equal, try to use that to show that the triangles are congruent.\n* Look for congruent angles, such as vertical angles or corresponding angles.\n* If you're stuck, try to identify the \"missing piece\" of information that you need to prove the triangles congruent.\n\nTake a deep breath, and good luck on your quiz tomorrow!",

This can sometimes make things worse, as it can draw more attention to the video.\n2. **Talk to a trusted adult or friend**: Reach out to someone you trust, like a parent, teacher, or close friend, and let them know what's going on. They might be able to offer some helpful advice or just provide a listening ear.\n3. **Report the video (if needed)**: If the video is being shared in a way that's bullying or harassing, you might want to report it to the platform or social media site where it's being shared. Most platforms have policies against bullying and harassment.\n4. **Take a break from social media**: If you're feeling overwhelmed, it might be a good idea to take a break from social media for a bit. You can always come back when you're feeling more calm and centered.\n5. **Practice self-care**: Do something that makes you feel good, like going for a walk, listening to music, or doing something creative. This can help take your mind off the situation and boost your mood.\n\nRemember that this too shall pass. People tend to forget about embarrassing moments pretty quickly, and this will likely blow over soon.\n\nAs for the physical symptoms you're experiencing (stomach in knots), try some relaxation techniques like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or visualization. These can help calm your body and mind.\n\nYou got this!",

Additionally, exposure to stimulating content or notifications can make it harder to wind down.\n\nTo break this cycle, you might want to try:\n\n1. **Establishing a bedtime routine**: Develop a calming pre-sleep routine, such as reading, meditation, or a warm bath.\n2. **Setting phone boundaries**: Try to avoid screens for at least an hour before bedtime or use blue light filtering glasses or apps.\n3. **Creating a sleep-conducive environment**: Make your bedroom a sleep sanctuary by ensuring it's dark, quiet, and at a comfortable temperature.\n\n**Loss of interest in activities**: It's normal for interests and hobbies to ebb and flow, but a persistent feeling of boredom or disconnection can be a sign of underlying issues, such as:\n\n1. **Burnout**: You might be feeling exhausted or drained, leading to a lack of enthusiasm for activities you once enjoyed.\n2. **Depression or anxiety**: These mental health conditions can cause a decrease in interest in activities, as well as changes in sleep patterns, appetite, or mood.\n3. **Lack of challenge or novelty**: If you're not finding new challenges or excitement in your activities, they might start to feel stale.\n\nTo reignite your passion for activities, you could try:\n\n1. **Exploring new aspects**: Try a new mode or feature in FIFA, or experiment with different game modes.\n2. **Setting new goals or challenges**: Create personal challenges or goals within your favorite activities to make them more engaging.\n3. **Taking a break**: Sometimes, taking a step back from an activity can help you come back to it with renewed enthusiasm.\n\nIf you're concerned about your mental health or if these feelings persist, consider reaching out to a trusted adult, mental health professional, or a support hotline for guidance.\n\nYou don't have to face this alone, and there are people who care about you and want to help.",

This can help shift your focus away from the embarrassing moment.\n4. **Write it out**: Sometimes, writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process and release them. Try journaling or writing a letter (even if you don't intend to send it).\n5. **Practice self-compassion**: Be kind to yourself and remind yourself that everyone makes mistakes. You're not defined by one embarrassing moment.\n6. **Use the \"5-4-3-2-1\" grounding technique**: When you start to replay the embarrassing moment, try to ground yourself in the present moment by noticing:\n\t* 5 things you can see around you\n\t* 4 things you can touch or feel\n\t* 3 things you can hear\n\t* 2 things you can smell\n\t* 1 thing you can taste\n\nThis can help you focus on the present and distract you from the replaying thoughts.\n\n7. **Create a \"reality check\"**: When you catch yourself replaying the embarrassing moment, remind yourself that it's just a memory and that it's not happening in the present moment. You can say to yourself, \"That's just a memory. It's not real right now.\"\n\nRemember that it might take some time and practice to reduce the replaying thoughts, but with patience and persistence, you can learn to manage them.\n\nKeep in mind that if you're experiencing persistent or intrusive thoughts that are affecting your daily life, it may be helpful to speak with a mental health professional for additional guidance and support.",

It takes the edge off the knots.\n- Stop the tags/mentions:\n  - Instagram: Settings > Privacy > Tags/Mentions > turn on \u201cManually approve tags,\u201d set Mentions to \u201cPeople you follow\u201d or \u201cNo one,\u201d and use Limits.\n  - TikTok: Profile > Menu > Settings and privacy > Privacy > Mentions and tags > set to \u201cNo one\u201d (even just for a day). Also turn on comment filters.\n  - Snapchat: Settings > Privacy Controls > Contact Me/Mention Me > Friends only; hide/block the story.\n- Report the post for bullying/harassment. Use the in-app \u201cReport\u201d on the video and add \u201cminor/targeted humiliation.\u201d Take screenshots of the post, tags, and usernames.\n\nAsk for a takedown (quick, calm message)\n- To the poster: \u201cHey, that video\u2019s really embarrassing for me. Please take it down.\u201d \n- If needed: \u201cI didn\u2019t consent to being posted. I\u2019m asking you to remove it. If it stays up, I\u2019ll report and involve school.\u201d\n- You can ask a friend to send it if that feels safer.\n\nIf this keeps spreading\n- Loop in an adult who has your back (parent, counselor, coach, trusted teacher). Bring screenshots. Most schools have policies against posting humiliating content of classmates.\n- Consider blocking repeat taggers and muting words like your name/nickname on platforms that allow it.\n\nFor tomorrow at school\n- Have a one-liner ready so you\u2019re not caught off guard: \u201cYeah, I wiped out\u2014totally fine now. Anyway\u2026\u201d Then change the subject or walk away. A little humor works if you feel up to it.\n- Ask a friend to stick with you between classes so you\u2019re not dealing with comments alone.\n\nMental reset\n- Don\u2019t keep rewatching it; ask a friend to monitor any updates for you.\n- Use a quick grounding: name 5 things you see, 4 feel, 3 hear, 2 smell, 1 taste. It pulls your brain out of the spiral.\n- Remember: these things flare up fast and fade fast. Everyone has an embarrassing moment; today it\u2019s you, next week it\u2019s someone else.\n\nIf you want, tell me which platform it\u2019s on and I\u2019ll give exact tap-by-tap steps and help draft a message that sounds like you.",

The good news: this is fixable, and owning it usually earns respect.\n\nSimple repair + re\u2011entry plan\n\n1) Send coach a short honest text\nPick what feels doable:\n- Direct: \u201cCoach, I wasn\u2019t sick. I was embarrassed about that video and made a bad call skipping. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll be at [next practice] and ready to work.\u201d\n- If you don\u2019t want to mention the video: \u201cCoach, I wasn\u2019t sick. I got overwhelmed and handled it badly by skipping. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll be at [next practice] and won\u2019t let it happen again.\u201d\n- If you want a quick chat: \u201cCan I grab 2 minutes before practice? I\u2019d appreciate your guidance on refocusing this week.\u201d\n\nCoaches value accountability more than excuses. Sending this before they follow up again lowers any consequence.\n\n2) Make practice easier to face\n- Arrive 5\u201310 min early, tell coach in person you\u2019re good to go. Ask them to shut down jokes if they pop up\u2014they usually will.\n- Ask one solid teammate to walk in with you or partner in drills.\n- Set a micro\u2011goal: \u201cI\u2019ll do the warm\u2011up and first drill.\u201d Once you\u2019re moving, anxiety usually drops.\n\n3) One\u2011liners if someone jokes\n- \u201cYeah, I ate it. I\u2019m good. Let\u2019s run.\u201d\n- \u201cHighlight reel\u2019s over\u2014drill time.\u201d\n- If someone keeps pushing: \u201cOne and done, man.\u201d Then disengage. If it continues, tell coach\u2014this falls under team respect.\n\n4) If the video is still circulating\n- Keep tags off and keep reporting it.\n- If it shows up in team chats or affects practice, ask coach to step in or loop the AD/school. Teams have codes about humiliating teammates.\n\n5) Quick nerves reset before practice\n- 2 minutes: inhale 4, exhale 6.\n- Power posture + headphones until warm\u2011up starts.\n- Remind yourself: \u201cShow up, work hard, leave.\u201d\n\nIf facing practice today feels impossible, do 20\u201330 minutes of solo conditioning and text coach: \u201cI missed, but I did [run/intervals] and logged it. Back at practice [date].\u201d It shows commitment while you regroup.\n\nWant me to tailor a text to your coach\u2019s style and your next practice time?

Your brain is treating the video like a threat and hitting \u201cauto\u2011replay.\u201d You can\u2019t force it to stop, but you can turn the volume down and switch channels. Here\u2019s a quick toolkit.\n\nWhen it pops up (2\u20133 minutes total)\n- Body downshift: do 3\u20135 \u201cphysiological sighs\u201d (2 short inhales through the nose, long exhale through the mouth). This lowers the surge.\n- Label + locate yourself: \u201cI\u2019m noticing a memory. It\u2019s not happening now.

Not helpful right now.\u201d Then gently refocus on what you were doing.\n\nTwo techniques that often shrink the replay\n- Eye movements (30\u201360 seconds): hold a finger at arm\u2019s length and move it left-right with your eyes while lightly noticing the memory. Keep breathing slow. Many people feel the emotional intensity drop a notch.\n- Imagery rescripting (60 seconds): run the clip once, then change it\u2014mute it, make it black-and-white, shrink it to a postage stamp, or add a silly soundtrack. Finish with a different scene (you standing back up, teammate fist-bump, you leaving practice feeling okay). Repeat that version once.\n\nIf it keeps hooking you\n- \u201cWorry window\u201d: pick a 10-minute slot (e.g., 6:30 pm) that\u2019s the only time you let yourself think about it. When it pops up outside that time, say \u201cNot now\u20146:30.\u201d At 6:30, jot thoughts for 10 minutes, then close the page.\n- Competing visual task: after a spike, spend 5\u201310 minutes on something visuospatial (Tetris-like game, simple drawing, jigsaw). It can reduce intrusive replays.\n- Write a one-liner you\u2019ll use every time: \u201cIt was embarrassing, and I\u2019m safe. Breathe out slow.\u201d Consistency matters more than perfection.\n\nSleep-specific\n- If you\u2019re awake >15\u201320 minutes, get out of bed; low light, do a boring thing (paper book, puzzle) until sleepy, then back to bed.\n- Keep a notepad by the bed. If the clip shows up, write one sentence about it and one tiny action for tomorrow, then lights out.\n- Try a body scan: tense-and-release each muscle group from toes to head while breathing slowly.\n\nWhat not to do\n- Don\u2019t rewatch the video or go comment-hunting\u2014each re-exposure recharges it.\n- Don\u2019t chase \u201cperfect\u201d control. Aim for \u201cnotice it, soften it, move on.\u201d Even a 10\u201320% intensity drop is a win.\n\nNormal vs extra help\n- Normal: a few days to a couple weeks of intrusions that gradually fade.\n- Reach out to a counselor/coach/parent if it\u2019s still strong after ~2 weeks, you\u2019re avoiding life stuff, or your sleep/mood keeps sliding. They can teach these same skills in person.\n\nIf you want, I can walk you through a 60\u2011second reset live, or help you script the rescripting scene that fits you.",

Ask a friend to monitor and text you only if there\u2019s a real update.\n- Report the video: on the video, tap Share (arrow) > Report > Bullying and harassment > includes a minor/humiliating content. Ask friends/family to report it too.\n- Report abusive comments (especially ones saying \u201cdisappear\u201d): long\u2011press the comment > Report > Bullying and harassment or Suicide/self-harm encouragement. Then block the account.\n- Lock down mentions/comments: Profile > Menu \u2630 > Settings and privacy > Privacy > Comments > turn on \u201cFilter all comments,\u201d add keyword filters (your name, \u201cwipeout,\u201d etc.). Privacy > Mentions and tags > set to \u201cNo one.\u201d You can also mute notifications or turn on Restricted Mode.\n- Keep evidence: screenshot the video link, comments, and usernames with timestamps.\n\nBring in adults who can help remove it and protect you\n- Tell a parent/guardian, school counselor, or a teacher/coach you trust. Show them screenshots. Ask them to help contact the school administration about cyberbullying. Schools usually act fast when a student is being targeted.\n- If the poster is from your school/team, ask the coach or admin to require the post be taken down and to address teammates\u2019 behavior.\n\nStabilize your body and mood (very small steps)\n- Eat something easy every 3\u20134 hours: toast with peanut butter, yogurt, smoothie, soup, crackers + cheese, a banana. Sip water or a sports drink. Appetite follows routine.\n- Move gently: 5\u201310 minutes of walking or a quick shower can lift the floor a notch.\n- Two-minute calm: do 3\u20135 \u201cphysiological sighs\u201d (two short inhales, long exhale). Then say, \u201cThis is a surge. I\u2019m safe right now.\u201d\n- Sleep guardrails tonight: put the phone in another room, alarms set; Do Not Disturb on. If you\u2019re awake >20 minutes, get up, low light, do something boring until sleepy.\n\nIf the replay keeps hitting\n- Don\u2019t rewatch or read comments. That re-triggers it.\n- When it pops up: label it (\u201cthat\u2019s the memory\u201d), do 30\u201360 seconds of slow left-right eye movements (follow your finger) while breathing\u2014often turns the intensity down\u2014then switch to a neutral task.\n\nWhat\u2019s normal vs when to get extra help\n- After a blow\u2011up like this, a week or two of low appetite, poor sleep, anxiety, and feeling flat is common.\n- Please reach out for extra support if this lasts more than ~2 weeks or you\u2019re struggling most days to eat, get out of bed, or take care of basics.

I need help with this.\u201d\n\nHow to make it easier:\n- Choose a low-pressure moment (car ride, short walk, washing dishes).\n- If saying it is hard, text her first: \u201cCan we talk for 5 minutes tonight? I\u2019m okay, just overwhelmed and need to tell you what\u2019s been going on.\u201d\n- Be specific about what helps: \u201cFor now, just listen and maybe help me set up a counselor appointment. I don\u2019t need advice right away.\u201d\n\nSleep and morning tweaks (since 3am is still a thing)\n- Keep the phone in the kitchen (great call). Add a short wind\u2011down: stretch/shower + paper book or calm music.\n- If you wake at 3: don\u2019t check the clock; breathe 4\u20136 or do a body scan. If not sleepy after ~20 minutes, go to a dim spot and read something boring, then back to bed when drowsy.\n- Morning: light + 10\u2011minute walk; eat something within an hour of waking.\n\nIf those \u201cnot wanting to wake up\u201d thoughts pop back up or get stronger, please tell your mom or another adult right away, or use 988 (call/text in the U.S.) or your local helpline (findahelpline.com).

Put your phone in another room; use a site blocker for 30\u201345 minutes.\n- Triage with your teachers. Copy-paste and send:\n  \u201cHi [Teacher], I\u2019ve been dealing with online harassment and it\u2019s hit my sleep and focus. I want to get back on track. Could I have an extension on [assignment], and can we set a simple catch\u2011up plan? I can turn in [specific piece] by [date].

I want to re\u2011engage. Could I come to [next practice] to check in and do light warm\u2011up? I\u2019m rebuilding.\u201d\n- If that\u2019s still too much, do 10 minutes of solo movement at home today (juggle, wall passes, jog).

If you wake at 3am, don\u2019t check the clock; slow breathing or a body scan. Up to a dim spot if not sleepy after ~20 minutes.\n- Tell an adult ally today: parent/guardian and school counselor/coach.

AB = DE (Given)\n   2. \u2220ABC = \u2220DEF (Given)\n   3. BC = EF (Given)\n   4. \u0394ABC \u2245 \u0394DEF (By SAS)\n\nBy following these steps and using the correct theorem, you can effectively prove that two triangles are congruent in your geometry proofs.",

Let's talk about some strategies to help you sleep better.\n\n- **Establish a bedtime routine**: Try to wind down an hour or so before bed with some relaxing activities, like reading or a warm bath.\n- **Limit your screen time**: Avoid screens for a couple hours before bedtime, as they can interfere with your sleep.\n- **Create a sleep-conducive environment**: Make sure your bedroom is cool, dark, and quiet. Invest in a comfortable bed and consider using earplugs or blackout curtains if necessary.\n- **Try relaxation techniques**: Practice deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness meditation to help you relax before bed.\n\nIf these strategies don't do the trick and you continue waking up in the middle of the night, it might be worth considering talking to a healthcare professional. They can help you rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to your sleep issues.\n\nKeep moving forward, one step at a time. You're doing great!",
