Those are all practical concerns, and it's okay to weigh them. It\u2019s a lot to juggle already, and adding another commitment feels daunting.\n\nThe bus fare... is there any way you could explore options for assistance with that? Perhaps your church has a fund for transportation, or there are community programs that could help?\n\nAnd the timing... could you look at their schedule and see if there's a session that might work, even if it's not ideal? Even just knowing the options might feel empowering.\n\nAs for not wanting folks to know how bad it\u2019s been\u2026 that's completely understandable. There's a lot of stigma around mental health, and it takes courage to be vulnerable. But remember, a support group is a *safe* space. Everyone there is going through their own struggles, and they\u2019re there to listen and support each other, not to judge. You don't have to share anything you're not comfortable with.\n\nMaybe start by just attending one session and seeing how it feels? You don't have to commit to anything beyond that. It could be a really valuable source of support, and you might find it helpful to connect with people who understand what you're going through.\n\nWhatever you decide, I'm here to support you.
