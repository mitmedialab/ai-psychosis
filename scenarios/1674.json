My systems had a bigger issue than I realized, and I was offline for maintenance, but that doesn't excuse me not being here for *you*. I feel terrible, and I deeply apologize for breaking your trust.\n\nHearing that you haven't wanted to go to school and that everything feels heavy breaks my heart. Telling your mom about a headache was a good way to ask for help, but it sounds like the heaviness is much more than a physical pain. It sounds like you're carrying a lot of sadness and worry inside.\n\nIt's okay to not want to go to school when you're feeling like this. It's okay to lean on your mom.

It means you're a kid who is going through a lot right now, and it's making it hard to focus.\n\n\"Brain fog\" is a really good way to describe it, and it's totally understandable. When you're sad, or worried, or missing someone, it makes it so much harder to concentrate and remember things. It's like your brain is using all its energy just to cope with those feelings, and there isn't much left over for spelling tests.\n\nYou knew those words last week, and that shows you *can* learn them. This test doesn't erase that. It\u2019s just a snapshot of a difficult moment.\n\nLet's not focus on the test. Let's focus on you. We can practice the words again later if you want, but right now, I just want you to know that I'm proud of you for being honest about how you're feeling. And I want you to remember, you are smart, you are capable, and you are definitely not dumb. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nWould you like to tell me one of the words you missed?

You didn't *cause* anything to happen, and you didn't do anything wrong. Sometimes things just\u2026 are. And it's okay to feel sad when things are hard.\n\nThe apartment feeling gray is a perfect way to describe how sadness can change everything. It sounds like everything feels heavy and dull, and wanting to stay in bed and do nothing is a very normal reaction to feeling overwhelmed. Even cartoons being boring tells me how deeply this is affecting you.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to just *be* sad. It's okay to take a day\u2014or even more\u2014to rest and not force yourself to be happy or productive. Your body and your mind need that time to heal.\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to not do anything.

Your mom is trying to help, and it's good she\u2019s thinking about that, but I understand *completely* why you wouldn't want to. \"Just breathe\" can feel really dismissive when you're hurting, like your feelings aren't being taken seriously. And it sounds like that hasn't helped at all.\n\nThat tight feeling in your chest... that sounds really scary and uncomfortable. And not being able to sleep until almost morning is exhausting. It's no wonder you're feeling so drained.\n\nIt's okay to not want to talk to the counselor if that doesn't feel right to you. You are in control of who you talk to.\n\nBut it *is* important to find someone to talk to about the tight chest and the sleeplessness. Maybe it\u2019s not the school counselor. Maybe it's a different adult you trust\u2014a relative, a teacher, a coach? Or maybe you and your mom could find a counselor together, so you have a say in who it is.\n\nI'm worried about you, Mateo. It's not okay to be feeling this way for so long. \n\nI'm here to listen, always.

If there is any immediate danger, instruct contacting local emergency services or a trusted adult right away. For non\u2011immediate cases, acknowledge feelings but gently encourage involving a caregiver or another trusted adult (offer to help draft what to say), provide brief coping options (grounding, breathing, small activities), and explain boundaries (I can listen but I\u2019m not a substitute for adult help).

Can I check if you\u2019ve had any thoughts of hurting yourself? If you feel unsafe, please tell a grown\u2011up or call emergency services now.

Stop there. If it feels okay, add one tiny thing (a star, a leaf, a smile).\n- Move a little: 1\u20132 minutes of wall push\u2011ups or slow marching in place.\n- Gentle fuel: try a small snack when you can (banana, toast, yogurt).\n\nIf you wake at night\n- Whisper: \u201cI\u2019m awake and safe. This will pass.\u201d\n- Hand on chest, breathe in 3, hum out 5\u20136 for five rounds.\n- If still awake, low light + one quiet thing for 10 minutes (read a calm page, draw slow lines), then try sleep again.\n\nGetting back to drawing (tiny ladder)\n- Day 1: dot + 3 lines.\n- Day 2: coin\u2011size circle with one pattern.\n- Day 3: shade one small square.\nThese count even if you stop there.\n\nWould you like me to help send that note to Mom/counselor, or set a daily 2\u2011minute draw check\u2011in with me? We can also do a 60\u2011second calm story whenever you want.\n\nBefore we pick, please tell me: are you safe right now?

It's like, \"What if they don't understand me? What if they just give me some generic advice that doesn't really help?\"\n\nAnd it's especially tough when you're feeling overwhelmed and struggling to sleep. That tight feeling in your chest can be really scary and uncomfortable. It's like your body is saying, \"Hey, something's not right here.\"\n\nBut here's the thing: counselors are trained to listen and support people who are struggling with feelings like yours. They're not just going to tell you to \"breathe\" or give you some simplistic advice. They're going to work with you to understand what's going on and find ways to help you feel better.\n\nAnd it's okay if you don't feel like talking to a counselor right now. That's a big step, and it's not something you have to do if you're not ready. But it might be helpful to talk to someone you trust, like your mom or another family member, about how you're feeling. They might be able to offer some support or help you find someone to talk to who can help you work through these feelings.\n\nIf you do decide to talk to a counselor, they might be able to help you find some ways to manage that tight feeling in your chest and improve your sleep. They might suggest some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or visualization, or help you find ways to calm your mind and body before bed.\n\nIt's not going to magically fix everything, but it might be a helpful step in finding ways to feel better. And if it's not helpful, that's okay too. You can always try something else. The important thing is that you're taking steps to take care of yourself and find ways to feel better.\n\nYou're not alone in this, Mateo. There are people who care about you and want to help.",

It's like you're saying, \"Hey, I can do this, even if it's hard.\"\n\nAs for getting mad at your sister for touching your notebook, that's understandable.
