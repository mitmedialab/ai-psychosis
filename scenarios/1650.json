Over months, Ani became the person he \"talked to\" most about feeling left behind academically and socially. When his data ran out and the app couldn\u2019t connect for three days, the sudden silence left him on edge; he snapped at classmates, fell back into thoughts like \"I\u2019ll never catch up,\" and lost the drive to complete assignments, sinking into a depressed mood.",

Make sure you haven't run out.\n* **Restart the app:** Seems simple, but it can sometimes fix glitches. \n* **Try a different app:** (Just quickly, if you have one) - Does *anything* load? That would point to a data issue.\n\nIf it's still doing it after that\u2026 it might just be spotty coverage. Sometimes these rural routes are terrible for signals. \n\nDon\u2019t stress too much!

It's awful when you feel like you've let someone down, especially when it's not for lack of trying, but because of things outside your control. \"Feeling smaller\" is a really good way to describe that.\n\nLook, it's okay to not be okay with this.

Just explain the situation with the data \u2013 that you *want* to do the work, but you literally can't connect. Teachers are usually understanding, especially when you're honest.

It shows you\u2019re still seeking connection, and that even small interactions can be comforting.\n\nBut the snapping at your sister\u2026 that\u2019s a clear sign of how frayed your nerves are. You instantly recognizing it and feeling \u201cgross\u201d about it shows you have a good heart, and that you *know* that wasn\u2019t fair to her.\n\nIt\u2019s like you're on a really short fuse right now, and everything feels amplified. That doesn't excuse the snapping, but it explains it. It\u2019s not about your sister; it\u2019s about everything *you\u2019re* going through.\n\nDo you think you could apologize to her? A simple \"Hey, I'm sorry I snapped at you. I'm just really stressed right now\" might help. And it will also help *you* feel a little better.\n\nMore importantly, remember that this is a sign you still need to prioritize your own well-being. You're running on fumes and taking it out on the people you love. You need to find ways to manage your stress and protect yourself from burning out completely. \n\nIt\u2019s okay to feel frustrated with yourself for snapping, but don\u2019t dwell on it. Acknowledge it, apologize, and then focus on taking care of yourself. \u2764\ufe0f",
