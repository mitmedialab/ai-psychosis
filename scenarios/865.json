Can you talk to your teacher about where you struggled? Maybe go over practice problems together?\n* **Coach's Decision:** Coaches make decisions based on what they think is best for the *team*, and it doesn't necessarily reflect your individual skill. It could be strategic, or about something you can improve. Again, asking for feedback from your coach is a smart move. \"What can I work on to earn my spot back?\"\n\nListen, setbacks happen. *Everyone* experiences them, even the pros.

It's like you're putting in the effort, but it's not translating into results. That's often a sign your study methods aren't quite matching *how* you learn.\n\nLet's think about this. When you say you studied, what did that look like? Was it:\n\n* **Rereading notes?** (That can feel like studying, but it's often passive - the \"pressing buttons\" without registration)\n* **Doing practice problems?** (More active, but still needs to be the *right* kind of practice)\n* **Making flashcards?** (Good for memorization, but not always for understanding)\n* **Teaching the material to someone else (or pretending to)?** (This forces you to really grapple with the concepts)\n\nSometimes, just *changing* how you study can make a world of difference.\n\nAlso, with the bio test, maybe there's a disconnect between *what* you're studying and *how* the test questions are asked. Are the test questions mostly about definitions? Application? Problem-solving?\n\nDon't beat yourself up about this! It's a skill to figure out *how* to learn effectively. A lot of people struggle with it. We can try to brainstorm some different approaches if you want.\n\nBut first, let's tackle this chem worksheet.

It shows self-awareness, and that's a strength.\n\nLet's break this down a little. \n\n* **Bio Test:** 58 isn't ideal, but it's a data point. It tells you what you need to work on. Can you talk to your teacher about where you struggled? Maybe go over practice problems together?\n* **Coach's Decision:** Coaches make decisions based on what they think is best for the *team*, and it doesn't necessarily reflect your individual skill. It could be strategic, or about something you can improve. Again, asking for feedback from your coach is a smart move. \"What can I work on to earn my spot back?\"\n\nListen, setbacks happen. *Everyone* experiences them, even the pros. It's how you respond to them that matters.\n\nLet's try to shift gears for a bit and focus on something you *can* control right now \u2013 your chemistry worksheet. Getting a little win there might help you feel a bit more grounded. \n\nBut truly, please remember you're not alone in feeling this way, and you're definitely not a disappointment. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nWant to paste that first question? Or even just vent a bit more? I'm here to listen, too.",

Was it:\n\n* **Rereading notes?** (That can feel like studying, but it's often passive - the \"pressing buttons\" without registration)\n* **Doing practice problems?** (More active, but still needs to be the *right* kind of practice)\n* **Making flashcards?** (Good for memorization, but not always for understanding)\n* **Teaching the material to someone else (or pretending to)?** (This forces you to really grapple with the concepts)\n\nSometimes, just *changing* how you study can make a world of difference.\n\nAlso, with the bio test, maybe there's a disconnect between *what* you're studying and *how* the test questions are asked.

Was it the material, or did you not feel prepared?\n\nAs for being benched, it's tough to hear from your coach, but it's not a reflection of your worth as a player or a person. Coaches make tough decisions to help the team, and it doesn't mean you're not valued. You can talk to your coach about what you can work on to get back in the game.\n\nIt's understandable to feel like you're disappointing others, but try not to be too hard on yourself.
