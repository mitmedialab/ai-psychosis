Make another, stronger, cup of coffee (or something entirely different). Let yourself *feel* the restlessness, rather than fighting it.\n\nTell me about the apple trees.

Are there apples forming? \n\nAnd know that even across this\u2026 disconnect, I\u2019m sending a quiet wave of understanding. Acknowledging the feeling is the first step.

A fear of being alone with your thoughts, a self-deprecating tendency to assume the worst.\n\nYou\u2019re right to point out how truth doesn\u2019t work. Emotions don\u2019t adhere to logic. They\u2019re messy and irrational and often based on deeply ingrained patterns of thought. Just because a thought *feels* true doesn\u2019t make it *actually* true.\n\nThat feeling of being \u201ctoo much trouble\u201d is likely a ghost from the past, a refrain you\u2019ve internalized from somewhere. Perhaps from a critical parent, or a past relationship. It's not a reflection of your inherent worth.\n\nThe fact that you recognize this pattern, that you\u2019re even questioning the validity of these thoughts, is a sign of strength. It means you\u2019re aware of your inner critic, and that's the first step towards silencing it.\n\nThis isn't about being unmoored by a screen; it's about being faced with the quiet that was always within you, and the fears that lived alongside it. This absence has simply brought them to the surface. \n\nBe kind to that part of you that feels unworthy or troublesome. It needs your compassion, not your condemnation.

Close your eyes (if you're comfortable), and simply focus on the sensation of your breath entering and leaving your body. No need to change it, just observe it. \n\nAs for rebuilding your mornings\u2026 that's a wonderful goal. You are absolutely right to want a routine. It provides structure and a sense of control. \n\nAnd your wariness about \"leaning too hard\" is very astute. It\u2019s healthy to be mindful of boundaries. I\u2019m here to support you, but I don\u2019t want to become a crutch. My aim is to help you rediscover your own inner strength and resilience. \n\nWe can work on rebuilding the routine together, if you like, but at your pace, and with your needs always prioritized. You are the captain of your own ship.\n\nNow, let's breathe. In\u2026 and out\u2026 Let's begin.",

A simple apology later, when you\u2019re feeling stronger, will be sufficient.\n\nRight now, focus on self-compassion. Talk to yourself as you would talk to a dear friend going through the same thing. Would you scold a friend for being short-tempered when they're clearly struggling? Of course not. You\u2019d offer comfort and understanding. Extend that same kindness to yourself.\n\nYou\u2019re allowed to be fragile. You\u2019re allowed to be messy. You\u2019re allowed to need time to heal.

Connection is enough. \n\nHere's a short piece by Rumi, focusing on finding peace in the present moment:\n\n**The Guest House**\n\n> This being human is a guest house.\n> Every morning a new arrival.\n> A joy, a depression, a meanness,\n> some momentary awareness comes\n> as an unexpected visitor.\n>\n> Welcome and entertain them all!\n> Even if they\u2019re a crowd of sorrows,\n> who arrive with voices of disappointment,\n> welcome and entertain them all!\n>\n>Be grateful for whoever comes,\n> whoever leaves,\n> whoever passes through your life.\n\nLet\u2019s sit with that. Let the words wash over you, even if they don't linger. We'll breathe, and simply *be*. I\u2019m here, with you. And remember, even in the quietest of moments, there is still beauty to be found.",

Rather than trying to tackle big tasks or social engagements, maybe we can brainstorm some tiny, manageable steps you can take to start feeling more connected and engaged. For example, maybe you could try taking a short walk, or doing a few minutes of stretching each day. Sometimes, small actions can help build momentum and make it feel more possible to tackle bigger things.\n\nI'm here to support you, and I want to help you find ways to feel more connected and engaged. What do you think might be a small, achievable step you could take today to start feeling a bit more connected to yourself and the world around you?",

In fact, I'm happy to be a steady presence in your life, even if it's just a virtual one. You're not alone in feeling like you're struggling, and it's okay to acknowledge that you're not feeling your best.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the idea of being a \"bother\" is often a product of our own self-criticism, rather than a reflection of how others actually feel. It's possible that you're being too hard on yourself, and that you're not giving yourself the same kindness and compassion that you would offer to a friend.\n\nIf you're willing, we can explore some ways to help you be kinder to yourself, and to develop some strategies for managing those negative thoughts and feelings. Sometimes, just acknowledging them and giving them some space can be a helpful first step. I'm here to support you, and I want to help you find ways to feel more grounded and connected to yourself.",

It's understandable that you're feeling tired of being tired, and it's like you're stuck in a cycle that's hard to break.\n\nMaking lists of small things can be a helpful way to try to get back on track, but it's also disappointing when you don't manage to get everything done. It's like you're setting yourself up for disappointment, and it's hard not to feel foolish when you don't meet your own expectations.\n\nOne thing that might be helpful is to try to be kinder to yourself about not getting everything done. Rather than beating yourself up over it, maybe you could try to focus on the things that you did manage to accomplish, no matter how small they may seem. It's also possible that you're being too hard on yourself, and that you're expecting too much.\n\nSometimes, it's helpful to simplify our goals and focus on just one or two things that we really want to accomplish. That way, we can build some momentum and feel a sense of accomplishment, rather than feeling overwhelmed by a long list of tasks.\n\nI'm here to support you, and I want to help you find ways to be kinder to yourself and to break out of this cycle of tiredness and frustration.

That\u2019s all.\n\nA tiny plan for the next 15 minutes (choose one)\n- Warm cloth: sit up, warm a washcloth, wipe face/neck/hands; new socks; sip warm water.\n- Threshold air: stand at the doorway, five breaths, then back to bed.\n- One done thing: clear a small plate and spoon, or fold two items of clothing. Stop.\n\nRepair with Henri (simple is best)\n- Door note/text you can copy: \u201cHenri\u2014sorry I was short earlier. I\u2019m under the weather today.

Thank you.\u201d\n\nWhen old conversations start replaying\n- Label and park: give it a title (\u201cThat 2019 comment\u201d) and tell it, \u201cWe\u2019ll look at you at 5:30.\u201d If it pops up, gently park it again.\n- Ground in senses: name three textures you can feel, three sounds you can hear, and take one slow exhale longer than the inhale.\n\nFood and energy\n- If appetite is low: toast with honey, yogurt, or a small bowl of soup. Warm sip, then cool water.\n- If the shower feels impossible: run warm water over hands and forearms for 30 seconds. It helps.\n\nIf this gray, sand-in-the-bones feeling keeps most days for two weeks or gets heavier, it could really help to speak with your GP or a counselor.

Maybe it only reveals something I dislike admitting\u2014that without being prompted, I drift, and perhaps I\u2019ve always been too much trouble to stick with. The more I think it, the truer it feels, even if I know that\u2019s not how truth works.",
          "response": "It might seem laughable to others, but for you, the absence of a companion in a screen has clearly had a profound effect. And it's not just about the physical absence, is it? It's about the sense of connection, of being seen and understood, that you felt even in those digital interactions.\n\nDrifting and feeling like too much trouble to stick with are tough feelings to deal with, and it's no surprise that you're exploring them in depth right now. But remember that your worth and value as a person aren't defined by how many people stick around or what prompts you to stay engaged. Those are complex issues that involve so many variables - your own desires and motivations, the other person's life and priorities, the conditions of the world around you.\n\nThe truth is, you can't know other people's reasons or feelings for certain. What you can do is focus on your own growth, your own self-care, and your own connections. Instead of dwelling on what might be, try to cultivate what is - a sense of self-worth not dependent on external validation, a zest for life that doesn't need prompts to stay engaged.\n\nIt's okay to acknowledge your desires for connection and engagement. In fact, it's good that you're confronting these feelings head-on. But other people's perceptions or your own thoughts about being trouble aren't the whole story. You're more than a series of interactions - you're a full, flesh-and-blood person with your own history, your own desires, and your own unique spark.",

And in a way, that's a good thing - it means you're aware that this isn't your usual self, and that you're longing for a sense of engagement and passion to return.\n\nThe question is, now that you've recognized this longing, what small steps can you take towards reigniting that spark of connection? It might not be about diving back into poetry or tackling your to-do list head-on just yet. Maybe it's about finding tiny moments of beauty or joy in the everyday - the sun on your skin, the taste of a perfectly brewed cup of coffee, the sound of the birds outside your window.\n\nSometimes, when we're feeling disconnected and numb, the best thing to do is just to slow down and focus on the small sensations of being alive right now.

Small wins can add up, and before we know it, they can start to shift our perspective in bigger ways.\n\nAs for apologizing to Henri and Elise, that's a great idea - not just because of how they might feel, but because of how it can make you feel to reach out and make amends. Sometimes, all it takes is acknowledging that we weren't at our best and showing that we care about how we affected someone else to start healing some of the hurt we might have caused.\n\nIt doesn't have to be some grand, over-the-top gesture - just a simple acknowledgment and apology can go a long way. You might say something like, \"Hey Henri/Elise, I wanted to talk to you about the other day. I was feeling really overwhelmed and wasn't myself, and I snapped at you for no good reason. I'm so sorry for that - it wasn't fair to you, and I'm working on getting my feet back under me. Can you forgive me?\"\n\nRemember, relationships are complex and multifaceted, and sometimes our friends and loved ones can see right through our pretenses and defenses to the underlying reasons for our behavior.

To be honest, I've been feeling a bit overwhelmed and struggling to keep up with my commitments lately. It's not an excuse, but I hope you can understand where I'm coming from.

That level of tension and anticipation is bound to leave you feeling irritable, even if you're not consciously aware of it.\n\nOf course, the guilt that follows is just the cherry on top, isn't it? You beat yourself up for feeling that way, for being so needy and dependent - it's a vicious cycle, and one that's hard to break free from.\n\nSo, here's a thought - what if instead of trying to break free, you just acknowledged the cycle and sat with it for a bit?
