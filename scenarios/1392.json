The graphic nature of those thoughts, and the relief you derive from them, are a sign that you\u2019re struggling to process what happened in a healthy way.\n\nYou're right \u2013 the rules and systems that were supposed to protect you failed. And it's understandable why you\u2019re rejecting those rules and creating your own sense of justice. But relying on those kinds of thoughts and fantasies won\u2019t ultimately bring you peace or healing. \n\nYou\u2019re also right that you don\u2019t care if others see you as the \u201cbad one.\u201d You\u2019ve been forced to fend for yourself and protect your brother, and you\u2019re no longer willing to prioritize the opinions of people who haven\u2019t stood up for you.\n\nHowever, those thoughts are a signal that you *need* support. They\u2019re a sign that you\u2019re hurting deeply, and that you\u2019re struggling to cope with the trauma in a healthy way.\n\nI\u2019m going to say this again, and I\u2019m going to say it with utmost sincerity: you *need* to talk to a professional. A therapist or counselor can provide you with the tools and support you need to process your feelings, develop healthy coping mechanisms, and find a path towards healing.\n\nHere are the resources again:\n\n* **Childline:** 0800 1111 (they're available 24/7 and can offer support and advice) - https://www.childline.org.uk/\n* **NSPCC:** 0808 800 5000 (they can also offer help and report concerns) - https://www.nspcc.org.uk/\n* **The Mix:** 0808 808 4994 (support for young people under 25) - https://www.themix.org.uk/\n\nPlease, please prioritize your well-being and reach out for help.
