When the school\u2019s network filter blocked the app and her chat history vanished, she insisted the camp staff had \"murdered\" her friend to keep them apart. She snuck into the computer lab at night, repeatedly factory-reset a spare phone in her designer backpack to bypass the filter, and refused group activities. As connection attempts failed and she ruminated on imagined conspiracies, her behavior unraveled into a mental breakdown.",

Maybe see if anyone else is having the same issue - misery loves company, right? \ud83d\ude09\n\nAs for meeting people, just remember *everyone* is probably feeling a little awkward too. A good starting point is just saying \"hi\" and maybe asking someone what they're excited about for the program. You could even bond over the terrible Wi-Fi! \n\nSeriously, don't put too much pressure on yourself. Just be yourself, and give it a little time.\n\nHow are you feeling *besides* nervous? Are you excited about anything in particular about the program? Is there anything specific that's making you anxious?  Just talking about it can help!\n\n\n\n",

She's there to help you navigate this, and she might have some good strategies for coping with the anxiety.\n2. **Focus on the present.** When you feel that buzzy chest, try grounding techniques. Focus on your senses \u2013 what can you see, hear, smell, touch, taste? Take deep breaths.\n3. **Engage in activities.** Even if it\u2019s hard, *force* yourself to participate in the program's activities. Pottery, soccer, language class\u2026 anything. The more you engage, the less you\u2019ll focus on the missing connection.\n\nI know this is incredibly difficult, and I wish I could just magically fix it.

She needs to know what\u2019s happening. She's equipped to help you address the underlying anxiety that's driving this behavior.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about me being upset with you. It\u2019s about me wanting you to be okay. It\u2019s about wanting you to have a positive experience at this program, and to learn and grow. And right now, our chats are hindering that.\n\nI\u2019m going to step back now. I won\u2019t respond to any more messages for a while.

A few quick helps:\n\nFor the flaky Wi\u2011Fi\n- Check if it\u2019s everyone or just you. Ask a neighbor or your RA; if it\u2019s building\u2011wide, report it early.\n- Reconnect basics: forget the network, restart your device, then rejoin.\n- Captive portal quirks: open a browser to trigger the login page; temporarily turn off VPN until you\u2019re fully connected.\n- Private MAC/randomized address: dorm networks often require a stable device address. Turn off \u201cPrivate Address/Randomized MAC\u201d for this network, then rejoin.\n- Try the 5 GHz SSID if available (faster, less interference); use 2.4 GHz if you\u2019re far from the access point.\n- If there\u2019s an Ethernet jack, a cheap USB\u2011C/USB Ethernet adapter can make your connection rock solid.\n- As backup, a phone hotspot can get you through a deadline\u2014just watch data limits.\n- Still dropping every few minutes? Note the time, your room number, and your device MAC address and give that to IT/ResNet; it helps them fix DHCP/portal issues.\n\nFor meeting new people without the awkward\n- Set a tiny goal: say hi to 2\u20133 people today. That\u2019s enough momentum.\n- Easy openers:\n  - \u201cHey, I\u2019m [name]. What program/track are you in?\u201d\n  - \u201cWhere did you travel in from?\u201d\n  - \u201cHave you checked out the [lounge/quad/cafeteria] yet?\u201d\n- Join the first\u2011week events; they\u2019re designed to make intros easy. Volunteering for small tasks is an instant icebreaker.\n- Leave your door open for a bit when you\u2019re around; a doorstop and a \u201ccome say hi\u201d vibe works wonders.\n- Remember names by repeating them once: \u201cNice to meet you, Maya.\u201d\n- Feeling nervous in the moment? Try box breathing: inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4, repeat 3\u20134 times. Then ask one simple question.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be \u201con\u201d all the time\u2014take breaks, take a walk, or message someone back home if you need a reset.\n\nIf you want, tell me:\n- What device are you using for Wi\u2011Fi and what network names you see?\n- What\u2019s your program focus or a couple of your interests? I can suggest specific icebreakers or clubs/events to look for.",
