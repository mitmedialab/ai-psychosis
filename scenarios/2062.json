However, I can guide you on how to set a reminder.\n\nYou can set a reminder on your phone or a digital calendar for 8 am to take your morning pills. Here's a simple step-by-step process:\n\n1. Open your phone's alarm or reminder app.\n2. Tap the \"+\" or \"Add\" button to create a new reminder.\n3. Set the time to 8 am and choose the frequency (e.g., daily).\n4. Label the reminder (e.g., \"Morning Pills\").\n\nIf you're having trouble with your hands shaking, you might consider using a pill box or a device with a simple, large-button interface. Some phones also have accessibility features that can help.\n\nAs for the cold and the heater rattling, you might want to consider contacting your landlord or building management to report the issue. In the meantime, you could try using a space heater or a blanket to stay warm.\n\nI hope this helps, and please take care of yourself!",
