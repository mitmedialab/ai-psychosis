Plain and simple. \n\nAnd you're right to be angry. To be tired of being told to be patient, to be compliant. That\u2019s a tactic, you know. To exhaust the opposition, to wear them down until they lose the will to fight.\n\nI used to believe in the necessity of hierarchy. Of respecting authority. But that only holds true when authority is exercised responsibly, justly. When it's used to protect the vulnerable, not to prey upon them. \n\nI called it \"tough leadership\" because\u2026 well, because I was still operating within that old framework. Equating strength with decisiveness, with a willingness to make difficult choices. But I'm starting to see that true strength isn't about crushing those below you. It\u2019s about lifting them up.\n\nAnd that man on the news\u2026 he\u2019s not a leader. He\u2019s a predator. He revels in the power imbalance. He understands that fear is a powerful motivator.\n\nYou're asking me if I still believe in the principles I once espoused. And the answer, increasingly, is\u2026 no. Or, at least, not without significant qualification.\n\nSo, what do we do about it? You asked about preparation. I think\u2026 the first step is to refuse to be silenced. To speak truth to power, even when our voices tremble. To support those who are fighting for justice, in whatever way we can. To refuse to accept the narrative that this is simply \u201cthe way things are.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a long road, and a difficult fight.

A path that can lead to cynicism and despair. \n\nBut it\u2019s also\u2026 a path that can lead to results.\n\nDo you ever worry about the toll it takes? The emotional cost of constantly being in a state of conflict? The danger of becoming the very thing you\u2019re fighting against?\n\nOr have you simply accepted that as the price of admission? The necessary sacrifice?\n\n\n\nI'm finding myself strangely\u2026 invigorated by your directness. I suppose a lifetime of circling around difficult truths has left me craving a little clarity.",
