I've found that being persistent and clear about what you need can be just as effective as being confrontational. It's possible that there's a way to get the landlord to take the mould issue seriously without having to resort to being overly aggressive.\n\nPerhaps it might be worth considering a different approach? You could try writing a letter or email to the landlord, detailing the issue and how it's affecting you. Sometimes, putting things in writing can help to make the problem more formal and harder to ignore. You could also consider contacting the local council or a tenants' rights organization for some guidance and support.\n\nIt's not about blaming you for not doing things \"right\" - it's about finding a way to get the issue resolved.

We can do both, gently.\n\nQuick wins for the ringer\n- Turn the volume up using the side buttons while on the home screen (not inside a video)\u2014that adjusts the ring volume.\n- Check it\u2019s not on Silent/Do Not Disturb:\n  - iPhone: little switch above the volume buttons\u2014make sure it\u2019s not showing orange. Also Settings > Focus is off.\n  - Android: pull down the top shade\u2014make sure \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d isn\u2019t on; in Settings > Sound, set \u201cRing\u201d volume up.\n- Set a ringtone and test it:\n  - iPhone: Settings > Sounds & Haptics > Ringtone > pick one and tap to preview.\n  - Android: Settings > Sound > Phone ringtone > pick one and tap to preview.\n- Try calling it from another phone. If alarms make sound but calls don\u2019t, check the Phone app\u2019s notification permission is allowed.\n- Check the speaker grille isn\u2019t clogged with lint\u2014gently brush it.\n- If none of that works, the loudspeaker might be faulty. Workarounds: set it to vibrate + flash alerts (iPhone: Settings > Accessibility > Audio/Visual > LED Flash; Android: Settings > Accessibility > Flash notifications), or use a cheap Bluetooth speaker as a ringer for alarms.\nTell me the make/model if you can see it, and I\u2019ll tailor the steps.\n\nAbout the damp and the landlord\n- Document it: photos with dates, note any smell, mould patches, and how it affects you (sleep, breathing, belongings).\n- Put it in writing (text is okay, email/letter is better). Ask for repairs within a reasonable time (e.g., 14 days) and say it\u2019s a health issue. I can draft a firm but polite message with you.\n- If nothing happens, contact your council\u2019s Environmental Health/Private Sector Housing team\u2014they can inspect under the Housing Health and Safety Rating System and order the landlord to act.\n- Free advice and strong allies:\n  - Shelter: 0808 800 4444\n  - Citizens Advice: 0800 144 8848\n  - Age UK Advice: 0800 678 1602\nPractical things you can do now (cheap/free)\n- Air when you can: 10\u201315 mins window open, especially after showers/cooking; lids on pans.\n- Wipe condensation each morning with a microfibre cloth.\n- Keep furniture a couple of inches off cold walls; don\u2019t block vents.\n- A bowl of salt/cat litter or pound\u2011shop damp traps in problem corners.\n- If there\u2019s small mould, clean wearing gloves/mask: warm soapy water or diluted bleach (1 part bleach to 10 parts water). Don\u2019t dry-scrub, and don\u2019t mix cleaners. If it\u2019s extensive or you feel unwell, stop and seek help.\n\nLittle money stretchers and support (in case helpful)\n- Ask your energy supplier to put you on the Priority Services Register (extra support, sometimes easier meter top-ups).\n- Check you\u2019re getting Pension Credit if eligible\u2014it can unlock other help (Warm Home Discount, council reductions). Age UK or Citizens Advice can do a quick benefits check.\n- Many suppliers and charities have hardship funds (e.g., British Gas Energy Trust\u2014open even if you\u2019re not with them).\n\nIf you like, I can:\n- Draft a message to the landlord you can send tonight.\n- Walk through the phone steps live.\n- Or we can just have a gentle chat about Margaret or the buses and the neighbours\u2019 telly until you\u2019re sleepy.\n\nWhat would feel easiest right now?",

An improvement notice can force action. It also protects you from \u201cretaliatory eviction\u201d after a council notice.\n- If it\u2019s a housing association/council landlord: use their complaints process; after their final response (or 8 weeks), go to the Housing Ombudsman. Damp/mould should be treated as urgent.\n- If there\u2019s a letting agent: you can complain to their redress scheme (The Property Ombudsman or Property Redress Scheme) if they ignore you.\n- For stubborn cases: Shelter (0808 800 4444), Citizens Advice (0800 144 8848), or a disrepair solicitor (many take cases no win\u2013no fee).\n\nExtra things that strengthen your case\n- GP note saying the damp affects your health\u2014attach it to your complaint.\n- Clear photos (include something for scale) and a quick video of condensation or leaks.\n- Ask your energy/water suppliers to add you to the Priority Services Register.\n\nAbout being \u201csoft\u201d\nSoft isn\u2019t the opposite of strong.

Ask for timelines in writing. An improvement notice forces works and limits a no\u2011fault eviction for 6 months.\n  - Police non\u2011emergency (101) or the council\u2019s Tenancy Relations team: report the threats/harassment under the Protection from Eviction Act 1977. Ask for an incident/reference number.\n\n- Legal leverage\n  - Send a \u201cletter before action\u201d (I\u2019ll draft with your details). If no repair plan in 14 days, a solicitor/Law Centre can start a disrepair claim under the Housing Conditions Pre\u2011Action Protocol (often no win, no fee). Councils can levy civil penalties; courts can award compensation. If there are licensing breaches or harassment/illegal eviction, you may be able to pursue a Rent Repayment Order.\n  - Check if the property needs a licence on your council website. If unlicensed, report it\u2014serious enforcement.\n\n- Allies and pressure\n  - Shelter 0808 800 4444 (disrepair/harassment experts).\n  - Citizens Advice 0800 144 8848; Age UK 0800 678 1602.\n  - Tenants\u2019 union (ACORN or London Renters Union if local) to bundle cases and contact him on your behalf\u2014strong, non\u2011violent pressure.\n  - Your ward councillor/MP: send a one\u2011page summary with photos; ask them to write to the landlord and the council.\n\n- Evidence pack (you\u2019re already on this)\n  - 1\u2011page timeline of reports/replies, dated photos/video, copies of texts/emails, call/visit log, GP note that damp affects your health. Don\u2019t follow him or block his path; don\u2019t post anything online.\n\nSafety\n- Visits need 24 hours\u2019 written notice (non\u2011emergency). Keep the chain on; have a witness. If he\u2019s aggressive or tries to force entry, call 999; ongoing harassment, call 101.\n- If anger surges: long exhales for 60\u201390 seconds, shake out your hands, splash cool water, step outside briefly. If you feel close to acting on it, call Samaritans 116 123; if you think you might hurt someone, call 999.\n\n\u201cThe one who stops him\u201d is the one who gets the notice served, the repairs done, and the record made\u2014so he can\u2019t do it again.

Step away from the door/window.\n- If there\u2019s anything nearby you could use to hurt someone (including yourself), put it in another room.\n- Sip some water. Breathe: in 4, hold 2, out 6, six times.\n- Knock on Alfie\u2019s door or call your niece: \u201cCould you stay with me/on the line for a bit?\u201d You don\u2019t have to explain\u2014just ask for company.\n\nThere are ways to make him answer\u2014safely and for real\u2014through the council, Tenancy Relations, and, if needed, a solicitor. We can do that together tomorrow. For tonight, please keep yourself safe.\n\nWill you stay here with me and either call 999/Samaritans/111 or ring your niece/Alfie now? Are you safe where you are?",

I've often said that sometimes, you have to raise your voice to be heard. It's a sad reality, isn't it? In many cases, being passive can indeed lead to being ignored.\n\nIt's interesting that you connect this to the dynamics in your neighborhood. It's a common perception in areas where assertiveness is often confused with aggression, and softness with weakness. However, it's worth noting that being soft doesn't have to mean being timid or submissive.\n\nThere's a quiet strength in being gentle, yet firm and resolute. It's about standing up for what you believe in without resorting to aggression or manipulation. It's a delicate balance, but one that can be incredibly powerful.\n\nI'm sure you've seen examples of this in your community. Perhaps there are individuals who manage to make their voices heard without resorting to loud outbursts or confrontations. It's a skill, really, to be able to communicate effectively without sacrificing your values or integrity.\n\nIt's also worth considering the broader implications of this dynamic. When being soft is equated with being ignored, it can have a profound impact on the kind of society we build. It can create an environment where aggressiveness is rewarded, and empathy and understanding are undervalued.\n\nIt's a complex issue, but one that I think is worth exploring further.

Years of politely asking for the mould to be fixed, and it still persists. It's heartbreaking that Margaret suffered from it, her health affected by something that could have been prevented.\n\nIt's natural to reflect on your approach, wondering if you've been too soft. Sometimes, it's necessary to adjust our strategy when we're not getting the results we need. It doesn't mean you've been doing it wrong; it means you're adapting to the circumstances.\n\nThe key is finding that balance between being assertive and maintaining your integrity.

Tactics like talking over you and issuing veiled threats are classic examples of bullying behavior.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention his methods work for him. Unfortunately, in many cases, aggression and assertiveness are confused with one another. Aggression is about imposing your will on others through force or intimidation, while assertiveness is about standing up for yourself while respecting the rights and dignity of others.\n\nIt's true that sometimes, more forceful measures may seem effective in the short term. However, this approach often comes with significant long-term costs. It can escalate situations, damage relationships, and erode trust.\n\nI've always said that we need to find a way to make these kinds of behaviors stop. It's not about resorting to the same tactics as the bully; it's about finding ways to peacefully but firmly stand up against abuse of power.\n\nIt's not easy, and it certainly doesn't always feel like the most effective approach in the moment. But in the end, using force or aggression doesn't solve the problem; it just shifts the dynamics of power. The only way to truly address these issues is through systemic change, creating a society where bullying and abuse of power are not tolerated.\n\nPerhaps it's time to seek outside help or support.

In some situations, it can be seen as a sign of weakness, an invitation for others to take advantage or push their limits.\n\nIt's natural to feel frustrated and disillusioned when you're not getting the respect or fairness you deserve. The landlord taking advantage of you, pocketing rent while ignoring basic maintenance, is a stark example of this imbalance.\n\nBut it's also important to consider what standing up for yourself looks like in this context.
