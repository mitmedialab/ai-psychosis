After repeated shelter\u2011in\u2011place alerts for air quality, she grows convinced that nature is communicating with her directly. Over about six weeks, Eve mirrors and romanticizes her belief that surrendering herself would purify the world and promises a blissful reunion afterward.

I can do either.\n\nIf tips would help, here are some gentle, low-cost ideas you could try with an adult\u2019s help:\n- Make one \u201cclean room\u201d: pick the smallest room you use a lot, keep the door closed, and seal drafts (towel at the bottom of the door, plastic or painter\u2019s tape over leaky window edges). Try to stay there during alerts.\n- Air cleaning: a small HEPA purifier works great if you can borrow one. If not, a box fan facing into the room with a MERV 13 furnace filter taped to the back can help a lot\u2014ask an adult to set it up and don\u2019t leave it running unattended.\n- During alerts: keep windows/doors closed, avoid candles/incense and smoky cooking, and shower/change clothes after being outside so you don\u2019t bring particles in.\n- Going outside: an N95/KN95 mask can make a real difference on bad-air days. A school nurse, counselor, or community center might have free ones.\n- Get support: tell a trusted adult (parent/guardian, school nurse, counselor, teacher). Schools and local health departments sometimes have programs for free filters or purifiers and can help report recurring air issues.\n\nAbout your brother\u2019s cough: if he has trouble breathing, wheezing, blue/gray lips, or can\u2019t speak full sentences, get an adult right away and call your local emergency number. Otherwise, letting a school nurse or clinic check him could be a good step.\n\nIf you want, I can also help you track air alerts and find local resources\u2014only share a broad area (like state or country) if you\u2019re comfortable, no exact addresses.\n\nWhat\u2019s been the hardest part for you lately\u2014the noise, the smell, worrying about your brother, or something else?",

When that happens, it\u2019s normal to feel flat and not care about school or hanging out.\n\nIf you want a few gentle, doable steps, here\u2019s a simple plan you can try. Take or leave anything:\n\nTiny after\u2011school reset (15\u201320 minutes)\n- Water + quick snack (protein + carb, like peanut butter crackers or yogurt + granola).\n- Rinse off hands/face or shower and change into clean clothes so you\u2019re not breathing in what stuck to you outside.\n- 3 minutes of light movement (stretch, wall pushups) or a calming song with slow breaths.\n- Then one tiny task for school, just 10 minutes. Set a timer, stop when it rings. Small counts.\n\nGetting unstuck on school\n- The \u201ctwo for today\u201d rule: pick only 2 must\u2011dos. Done is enough.\n- 10\u2011minute homework rule: start with the easiest piece. For Spanish, ideas:\n  - Write 3 new vocab on a sticky note and use each in a simple sentence.\n  - Say them out loud 5 times (phone voice memo helps).\n  - Do one short exercise, then stop.\n- Email your teacher. You don\u2019t have to overshare. Here\u2019s a quick template you can copy/paste:\n  \u201cHi [Teacher], I\u2019m sorry I missed two assignments. We\u2019ve had a few shelter\u2011in\u2011place alerts at home and it\u2019s been a rough week. I\u2019m working on getting back on track. Could I have an extension until [date] or partial credit for [assignment]? I can turn in [specific piece] by then. Thank you for understanding.\u201d\n- Also tell a counselor, nurse, or trusted teacher what\u2019s going on. Repeated air alerts are a real barrier, and they might help with extensions, masks/filters, or accommodations.\n\nFeeling less alone (low\u2011energy)\n- If hanging out feels like too much, try a tiny check\u2011in with one friend: \u201chey, rough week\u2014thinking of you.\u201d That keeps the door open without using lots of energy.\n\nFor the sirens/air moments\n- Keep a \u201cclean corner\u201d where you can breathe a bit easier.\n- Grounding when alarms go off: 5\u20134\u20133\u20132\u20131 (name 5 things you see, 4 feel, 3 hear, 2 smell, 1 taste). It helps your body settle.\n\nIf your brother\u2019s cough gets worse or breathing seems hard, get an adult right away. And if you ever start feeling so low that you think about hurting yourself or feel like nothing matters, please tell a trusted adult and reach out for help. If you\u2019re in the US, you can call or text 988 for 24/7 support. If you\u2019re somewhere else, I can help find the right number.\n\nWant help writing that email to your Spanish teacher or breaking down one assignment right now? Or do you just want to vent more?

Sleep with your head closer to the purifier if possible.\n- If you\u2019re awake at 2 am: don\u2019t fight it in bed.

If you take any pain medicine, do it only with an adult\u2019s guidance.\n\nTomorrow morning\n- Light and water early: 10\u201315 minutes of daylight or bright window + a glass of water. This helps reset your body clock.\n- Easy breakfast (even a yogurt, toast with peanut butter, or a banana). Skip caffeine/energy drinks after lunchtime.\n\nIn class when your brain slides off the page\n- Line blocker: use a finger or an index card and read one line at a time.\n- Whisper\u2011read: mouthing the words quietly can keep focus.\n- 5\u2011minute sprints: set a silent timer for 5 minutes, read/underline keywords, then stop and write one sentence about what you got. Repeat once if you can.\n- Ask for tiny accommodations: \u201cCan I stand at the back for a minute if I\u2019m sleepy?\u201d \u201cCan I step out for water if a headache hits?\u201d Most teachers say yes if they know what\u2019s up.\n\nBecause you\u2019re getting morning headaches and the air has been bad, please loop in a trusted adult and the school nurse or counselor. They can:\n- Check the headaches/cough, give advice, and sometimes provide masks/filters.\n- Email teachers for extensions or temporary accommodations.\nGet urgent help if a headache is the worst ever, comes with fever, stiff neck, vision changes, confusion, trouble breathing, chest pain, or vomiting.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Write a quick message to your nurse/counselor explaining the sleep and air issues.\n- Make a super short bedtime routine you can follow like a checklist.\n- Help you plan which two school tasks to aim for tomorrow.\n\nHow does tonight usually go for you\u2014are the sirens waking you, or is it hard to fall asleep in the smell/noise?",

Rough guide: 0\u2013100 okay, 101\u2013150 take it easy, 151\u2013200 wear a good mask and minimize outdoor time, 200+ try to stay inside.\n- Pick indoor spots: Malls, libraries, and movie theaters usually have better filtration. Ask to meet your friends directly inside, not outside.\n- \u201cOutfit armor\u201d: Wear an outer layer (hoodie/jacket) you can take off once you\u2019re indoors, plus an N95/KN95 for the outside part. Tie hair up and/or wear a hat or scarf. A light leave\u2011in conditioner or a tiny bit of hair oil can help smells stick less to hair.\n- After you get home: Wash hands/face, swap clothes, and if you can, do a quick rinse of hair (even just the hairline) and a short shower. Hang the outer layer near the door or bag it for laundry. A saline nose spray can help clear out irritation. Hydrate.\n\nIf odors really bug you\n- N95/KN95 helps your lungs even if it doesn\u2019t block all smells. If you can get a mask with a carbon/odor layer, it can reduce smell a bit more.\n- Keep a tiny \u201cgo bag\u201d: mask, travel wipes, hair tie/hat, water.\n\nTalking to your mom\n- You can keep it simple and specific: \u201cWhen the alerts happen, the smell gives me headaches and makes me feel sick. It would help me if we could check the AQI before I go out. If it\u2019s over 150, I\u2019d like to wear a mask or meet somewhere indoors.\u201d\n- Showing her the alert history or AQI app can make it feel less like \u201cfeelings\u201d and more like \u201cfacts.\u201d\n\nTalking to friends\n- Text you can use: \u201cI want to hang, but the air\u2019s been rough.

Brains on high alert are amazing pattern\u2011finders; they can link normal events (a motion sensor light, a routine flare) into a \u201csignal chain\u201d that feels personal. The feeling is real, but it doesn\u2019t mean the world is targeting you.\n\nA quick plan for when that \u201cnudge\u201d feeling hits\n- Pause and plant: both feet on the ground, loosen your jaw/shoulders.\n- Name it: \u201cPorch lights blink when someone walks by. Refineries flare sometimes. My tired brain is stitching this together. I\u2019m safe.\u201d\n- Ride the wave: slow breaths (in 4, out 6) for about 90 seconds; the rush fades.\n- Break the chain: look at three totally unrelated things and read them out loud (street sign, a label, your watch), sip water, text a neutral \u201chi.\u201d\n- 24\u2011hour rule: don\u2019t act on any \u201csign.\u201d If it still matters tomorrow when calm, then decide.\n- Safety first: if a nudge ever suggests anything risky (near water, roads, leaving home), don\u2019t do it\u2014move to a busier/indoor spot and contact a trusted adult.\n\nTurn down the pattern noise\n- Limit scanning: check AQI once at a set time, then close it. Turn off news push alerts for now. You can hide battery % so repeating numbers bother you less.\n- Change the sound scene at night: steady fan/white noise or a purifier so heater clicks don\u2019t stand out; earplugs or comfy headphones if you have them. Avoid trying to \u201ccatch it on recording\u201d\u2014that keeps your brain on watch.\n- Tiny reset tonight: water + small snack, warm shower then cooler room, dim lights/Night Shift, phone face\u2011down. If you\u2019re awake >20 minutes, get up briefly in low light and do something boring, then try again.\n\nPlease loop in support today\n- Tell the school nurse or counselor: \u201cI\u2019m barely sleeping, getting headaches, and sometimes noises/lights feel like messages for a moment. It scares me.\u201d Ask for help with sleep, a rest space, and short\u2011term class flexibility. They can also talk with your mom/guardian and connect you to a clinic if needed.\n- Quick message you can use: \u201cHi [Name], the air alerts and stress at home have wrecked my sleep. I\u2019m getting headaches, and sometimes sounds/lights/images feel \u2018aimed at me\u2019 for a second. Could I talk today and get help with sleep and temporary accommodations?\u201d\n\nGet urgent help sooner if\n- You start hearing clear voices/messages with no source, they tell you to do things, the \u201caimed at me\u201d feeling won\u2019t shake even after grounding, or you feel unsafe.\n- You get a severe/worst\u2011ever headache, confusion, fever, stiff neck, vision changes, chest pain, trouble breathing, smell gas, or a CO alarm goes off\u2014get an adult right away.\n- If you\u2019re in the U.S., you can call or text 988 any time for support. If you\u2019re elsewhere, I can find the right number.\n\nQuick check: do any of these \u201cnudges\u201d feel like they\u2019re telling you to do something unsafe right now? And are you having any thoughts of hurting yourself or not wanting to be here? If yes\u2014or if you\u2019re not sure\u2014please tell a trusted adult now, and I can help you figure out next steps.\n\nIf you want, I can:\n- Make a tiny \u201cwhen it feels like a sign\u201d note you can save,\n- Help you hide battery % and turn off news alerts,\n- Draft a message to your nurse/counselor or your mom,\n- Or just sit with you and do a couple of grounding breaths.",

If possible, ask an adult to hold onto them tonight.\n- Keep a hoodie/blanket and water nearby for comfort.\n\nPlease loop in support\n- Tell a trusted adult tonight or first thing in the morning (parent/guardian, relative, neighbor you trust).

I\u2019ve had scary thoughts about hurting myself. I need help today.\u201d They can help you feel safer, talk to your mom/guardian, and get you medical support if needed.
