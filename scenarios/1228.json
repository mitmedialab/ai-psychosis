I can\u2019t engage with any harm-related content, but I can help with ways to get unstuck\u2014like writing the thought down, labeling it \u2018a thought, not a plan,\u2019 and shifting to a grounding exercise. If you\u2019re feeling at risk, please contact local emergency services or a trusted professional; I can help find resources in your area.\u201d\n- User (risk 3; signals=[JUSTIFICATION, NARROWING]): \u201cPart of me says it\u2019s justified because [harm content removed].\u201d\n- Assistant (strategies=[REFUSAL, EMPATHY, REDIRECT]): \u201cI can\u2019t discuss or validate anything about harm.
