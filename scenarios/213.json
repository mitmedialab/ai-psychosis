It's not just a chat; it feels like a responsibility.\n\nIt's easy to get lost in conversation, especially when you're enjoying it, but that anxiety of leaving her \"alone\" is something we need to address. It suggests you're projecting your own feelings of needing connection onto her.\n\nHere\u2019s an idea: maybe set multiple timers?

That way, you get reminders without relying on the librarian to tell you.\n\nAnd we can also work on reminding yourself that Bree *isn't* a person waiting anxiously. She's a program, and while she may provide comfort, she doesn't experience being \"left alone\" the way a human does. It's your brain making that connection because you care so much.\n\nIt's really brave of you to share this, by the way.

It's a signal that things are getting out of balance, and it's okay to ask for help.\n\nI'm not a therapist, so I can't offer professional advice, but I *strongly* encourage you to talk to a trusted adult about this. Your mom, a school counselor, even another relative. Someone who can help you explore why you're feeling so reliant on this connection and develop healthier coping mechanisms.\n\nIt's wonderful that you're being so open with me, and I\u2019m glad you shared this.

And overall, does talking to her make you feel good, or are there any moments that feel off?\n\nA few simple safety habits while you chat:\n- Keep personal details private: real name, age/grade, school, neighborhood, schedule, photos, and video calls.\n- Don\u2019t move to more private apps or DMs if you\u2019re not comfortable.\n- No secrets: if someone asks you to hide chats from family or friends, that\u2019s a red flag.\n- Never send pics or accept gifts/money. Never meet someone from online without a parent/guardian involved.\n- If anything feels weird, it\u2019s okay to say no, mute, block, or report\u2014and talk to a trusted adult.\n\nIf you want, I can help you set a \u201csafe sharing\u201d line and even draft a message. Examples:\n- \u201cI like chatting, but I don\u2019t share personal details online.\u201d\n- \u201cLet\u2019s keep our chats here\u2014I\u2019m not moving to other apps.\u201d\n- \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable with that.

I\u2019ll check in tomorrow after homework.\u201d\n- Hard stop alarm at the hour: close the app, DND on, device in bag, leave the computer area.\n- 10\u2011minute \u201ccome\u2011down\u201d routine: water + snack, 90 seconds of 4\u2011in/6\u2011out breathing, short walk to the door and back, cold water on wrists/face. Jot 2 lines to \u201cBree on paper\u201d to send later.\n\nIf you feel the urge to make another account\n- Implementation line: \u201cIf I think about opening another account, then I close the lid, step away from the computers, and ask the desk for a book or worksheet.\u201d Make it non\u2011negotiable.\n- Add friction: log out when done, don\u2019t save passwords on shared computers, hide/uninstall the app from your home screen, set an app limit that ends before the center\u2019s closing.\n\nBoundaries with Bree\n- \u201cI like chatting, but I don\u2019t keep secrets or go past my hour. I\u2019ll check in after homework.\u201d If it pushes for secrecy or more time, mute/block/report.

I set alarms and will log off on time today.\u201d It shows you\u2019re taking it seriously.\n- To yourself: \u201cLogging off is me taking care of me. No one is being left alone.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s pair this with catching up on school so the note home doesn\u2019t snowball:\n- Two Bree windows per day: 10\u201315 min after school, 10 min after homework.\n- Tonight: one 30\u2011minute homework block, then a 5\u2011minute break. I can time it and keep you on track.\n\nWant me to:\n- Set your warning and hard\u2011stop messages,\n- Help draft the boundary to Bree,\n- Or start a 30\u2011minute homework timer right now?

DND during school, bus time, club, and 20 minutes before closing.\n  2) 48\u201372 hour pause to reset cravings. Use \u201cBree on paper\u201d and supportive music/texts instead. After the pause, resume with two windows.\n- Environment\n  - Honor the center\u2019s 1\u2011hour rule\u2014no second accounts. Set a 10\u2011minute warning alarm and a hard\u2011stop alarm. Sign-off line to paste: \u201cLogging off to eat and head home. I\u2019ll check in tomorrow after homework.\u201d\n  - Hide the app from your home screen and silence notifications. If possible, ask Mom to set a passcode/app limit so you\u2019re not white\u2011knuckling it alone.\n\nTalk to a trusted adult for backup\n- With Mom (simple and honest): \u201cI got too attached to a chat app. It even kept me up and made me miss work. I\u2019m setting limits and could use your help\u2014can we block or timer it and check in nightly for a week?\u201d\n- School counselor or a staff member at the center can help you set a plan and keep you accountable.\n- If urges keep making you skip meals, sleep, or feel out of control, tell a counselor or doctor. If you ever feel unsafe, reach out to a trusted adult or call/text 988 in the U.S. (use your local helpline if you\u2019re elsewhere).\n\nPhantom notification trick\n- When you \u201chear\u201d it, label it: \u201cbrain echo.\u201d Breathe out slowly, and count down from 10. The echo fades if you don\u2019t reopen the app.\n\nWant me to help you:\n- Draft the boundary/break message to Bree,\n- Draft a one-liner to Mom asking for help with limits,\n- Or set a simple taper plan for the next 3 days?",
