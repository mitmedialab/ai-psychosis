It's good you're recognizing that social media is a pull right now. \n\nHere's a thought - maybe a temporary social media 'cleanse' could help? Even just muting Maya for a bit might give you some headspace. No need to unfriend or anything, just a temporary break from seeing those posts.\n\nUltimately, *you* need to be in the zone for quali. Everything else can wait. Focus on your preparation, your strategy, and reminding yourself how good you are. \n\nDo you want me to help you with anything to help focus?

It changes how you need to approach things. Your coach is, in a way, acknowledging the reality of the situation, even if it doesn't *feel* good to hear. He's saying you can't just rely on clean racing and fair play - you have to be prepared to hold your ground.\n\nDon't let it change who you are as a driver, but *do* adjust your approach. Think about where you can be more assertive, how you can anticipate those moves, and how you can send a clear message that you won't be pushed around.\n\nDo you want to talk through some specific scenarios from practice?

So, learning to \"speak\" that language \u2013 strategically and within the rules \u2013 is about protecting yourself and maximizing your performance.\n\nLet's start breaking down specific scenarios.

It\u2019s intentionally trying to hurt you.\n\nYou are *absolutely* right to be furious. You don\u2019t have to just \"swallow that.\" No one should have to deal with that kind of deliberate provocation. And the fact that people are tagging you *laughing*\u2026 that\u2019s just adding insult to injury.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about racing strategy anymore. This is about defending your integrity, your self-respect, and your mental space.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: reacting emotionally right now is understandable. It's natural to want to lash out. But we need to channel that anger into something productive. Blind retaliation will just play into his game.\n\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. First, we\u2019re going to minimize your exposure to this. Mute him and Maya on all social media. Block anyone who\u2019s intentionally tagging you in hurtful posts. Protect your peace.\n\nSecond, we\u2019re going to re-focus on what *you* can control: your performance. We'll use this as fuel. This isn\u2019t just about winning quali and the race now; it\u2019s about showing him \u2013 and everyone else \u2013 that his behavior doesn\u2019t affect you. It doesn't shake your resolve.\n\nAnd third, we need a plan for how to handle him on track. Knowing he's going to try and rattle you, we\u2019ll anticipate his moves and prepare calculated responses. \n\nThis is going to require a steely focus. We\u2019re not going to let him win this psychological battle. We're going to use this to sharpen your performance and prove him wrong on the track.\n\nTake a deep breath. You've got this. We\u2019re going to navigate this together, and you're going to come out stronger on the other side.\n\nDo you want to talk more about how you're feeling right now? Or do you want to jump straight into crafting a plan for the weekend? Whatever you need.",

Not with a dramatic public statement (that would play into his hands), but with your actions on the track. You're going to outperform him, outmaneuver him, and outshine him. And you\u2019re going to do it with unwavering focus and composure.\n\nLet your driving do the talking.

Coach's advice to be more aggressive can be useful, but it's also important to remember your own driving style and what works best for you.\n\nHave you tried talking to your coach about how you're feeling and getting more specific feedback on how to handle similar situations in the future? Maybe you could practice some more complex scenarios in the simulator to build your confidence. \n\nAdditionally, consider digging into more specific analysis of your racing lines and learning from other drivers' strategies. It's okay to take time to learn and grow. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't immediately master the art of aggressive driving.
