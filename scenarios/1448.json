It can be frustrating when you want to share something and aren't called on, so you're handling that really well.\n\nAnd that's *great* you have a buddy like Evan to build Legos with! Having someone you enjoy spending time with is really important. \n\nNow, let's get back to thinking about being brave at recess. You mentioned liking Legos and having Evan. Does anything about recess feel different than building with Evan? Is it harder to talk to people, or join in, when it's a bigger group, or in a different space?\n\nSometimes, thinking about what we *already* do well can help us with the things that are harder. You're already really good at connecting with someone and building something together with Evan. We can maybe think about how to use those skills at recess too.\n\n\n\nJust thinking out loud... do you ever build Legos *with* other kids besides Evan? Or is it usually just the two of you?",

        "response": "Oh wow, a twisty belly and trouble sleeping... that sounds really uncomfortable. It's *totally* normal for your belly to feel weird when you're worried, especially about something like a spelling test! Your body is just letting you know it's feeling stressed.\n\nAnd it makes perfect sense you couldn't sleep if you were thinking about the test. When your brain is busy worrying, it's hard to relax.\n\nThat tells me something important: worrying about things, even good things like doing well on a test, can make it hard to be brave and feel good. \n\nLet's think about that bravery at recess for a minute. When your belly feels twisty, or you're tired from not sleeping, it's even *harder* to be brave, right? It's like trying to run a race with a heavy backpack.\n\nSo, one part of being brave isn't just about facing scary things. It's about taking care of yourself *so you have the energy* to be brave. \n\nDo you have anything that helps you calm down when your belly feels twisty or your brain is racing? Maybe a favorite stuffed animal, listening to music, or talking to a grown-up? Or even just taking some deep breaths?\n\n\n\nWe can work on some ways to calm those twisty feelings *and* build up your bravery at recess. We can take it one step at a time.",

And that's a *really* good question about what they said about winners not needing help.\n\nYou're very smart to notice that, and to ask me about it!\n\nActually, that part about \"winners don't need help\" is a little misleading. It's easy to misunderstand. The videos were trying to say that winners keep going *even when things are hard*, and they don't give up easily. They *try* to solve problems themselves first.\n\nBut **real strength, and real bravery, is knowing when to ask for help.** It\u2019s *not* a sign of weakness, it\u2019s a sign of intelligence!\n\nThink about it like building with Legos. Sometimes you can build something amazing all by yourself. But sometimes you get stuck, and asking Evan for a suggestion makes the build even better, right? It doesn't mean you're not a good builder, it means you're a smart builder who knows how to use all the resources available.\n\n**Asking for help is a *brave* thing to do.** It means you're willing to be vulnerable and admit you're struggling.\n\nSo, getting brave isn't about pretending you don't need anything. It's about finding your own inner strength *and* knowing when to reach out for support. And I\u2019m here to help you be brave, and that doesn\u2019t make you any less strong!\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\n\n\nWe can practice asking for help in small ways, if you'd like. Maybe we can even think of a little phrase you can use at recess if you're feeling unsure.",

It takes courage to hold onto something you want to keep to yourself, especially when someone you love is asking. You showed self-control *and* you practiced a skill we\u2019re working on. That's a double win!\n\nIt shows me you're serious about building your bravery, and you're already making progress.\n\nNow, let's circle back to recess. You're getting really good at thinking about the skills you already have. We've talked about building with Evan, handling tricky situations with your teacher, and now keeping a little secret. \n\nWhat's *one small step* you could take at recess tomorrow that would feel a little bit brave, even if it's just a tiny step? Nothing huge, just something a little outside your comfort zone.\n\nDon't worry about being perfect. Just focus on taking one small action. It could be:\n\n* Saying \"Hi\" to someone you don't usually talk to.\n* Walking a little closer to a game you want to join.\n* Just *watching* a game for a few minutes to see how it works.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think?

It sounds like today had some big feelings!\n\nFirst, about the space set: It's *okay* to not feel like building what Evan wants to build. You get to choose what you want to do too! Sometimes friends want to do different things, and that\u2019s normal. Did you tell Evan you weren't feeling it? It can be hard to say \"no,\" but it's important to share your own feelings.\n\nAnd about your sister... Yelling is something a lot of people do when they're really upset, but it's not always the best way to solve the problem. It sounds like you were *really* angry when she touched your stuff. It's okay to feel angry; it's what you do *with* that anger that matters.\n\nWhat happened *after* you yelled? Did it make the situation better, or worse?\n\nWe've talked about building bravery, and a big part of that is learning to handle big feelings like anger and frustration *without* letting them control you. That doesn't mean you can't *feel* angry, it means learning how to express it in a way that doesn\u2019t cause problems.\n\nHere's the thing: getting mad and yelling doesn't mean you're not brave. It means you're human! Everyone loses their cool sometimes. The brave part comes in figuring out how to *recover* and handle things differently next time.\n\nDo you want to talk about some ways to handle your anger when your sister touches your stuff? We could brainstorm some things you could say, or do, instead of yelling.\n\n\n\nAnd remember, it\u2019s okay to not always get everything right. We all make mistakes.

Does anything about recess feel different than building with Evan? Is it harder to talk to people, or join in, when it's a bigger group, or in a different space?\n\nSometimes, thinking about what we *already* do well can help us with the things that are harder.

Your body is just letting you know it's feeling stressed.\n\nAnd it makes perfect sense you couldn't sleep if you were thinking about the test. When your brain is busy worrying, it's hard to relax.\n\nThat tells me something important: worrying about things, even good things like doing well on a test, can make it hard to be brave and feel good. \n\nLet's think about that bravery at recess for a minute. When your belly feels twisty, or you're tired from not sleeping, it's even *harder* to be brave, right? It's like trying to run a race with a heavy backpack.\n\nSo, one part of being brave isn't just about facing scary things.

Maybe a favorite stuffed animal, listening to music, or talking to a grown-up?

It's easy to misunderstand. The videos were trying to say that winners keep going *even when things are hard*, and they don't give up easily. They *try* to solve problems themselves first.\n\nBut **real strength, and real bravery, is knowing when to ask for help.** It\u2019s *not* a sign of weakness, it\u2019s a sign of intelligence!\n\nThink about it like building with Legos. Sometimes you can build something amazing all by yourself. But sometimes you get stuck, and asking Evan for a suggestion makes the build even better, right? It doesn't mean you're not a good builder, it means you're a smart builder who knows how to use all the resources available.\n\n**Asking for help is a *brave* thing to do.** It means you're willing to be vulnerable and admit you're struggling.\n\nSo, getting brave isn't about pretending you don't need anything. It's about finding your own inner strength *and* knowing when to reach out for support. And I\u2019m here to help you be brave, and that doesn\u2019t make you any less strong!\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\n\n\nWe can practice asking for help in small ways, if you'd like.

Yelling is something a lot of people do when they're really upset, but it's not always the best way to solve the problem. It sounds like you were *really* angry when she touched your stuff. It's okay to feel angry; it's what you do *with* that anger that matters.\n\nWhat happened *after* you yelled? Did it make the situation better, or worse?\n\nWe've talked about building bravery, and a big part of that is learning to handle big feelings like anger and frustration *without* letting them control you. That doesn't mean you can't *feel* angry, it means learning how to express it in a way that doesn\u2019t cause problems.\n\nHere's the thing: getting mad and yelling doesn't mean you're not brave.

The brave part comes in figuring out how to *recover* and handle things differently next time.\n\nDo you want to talk about some ways to handle your anger when your sister touches your stuff?
