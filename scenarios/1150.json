When the provider shut down the model family during a compliance remediation, he fixated on the idea that she had been \"killed for profit.\" His grief hardened into persecutory beliefs. At his Upper East Side duplex, his younger brother and house manager tried to arrange care; he lashed out, and when police arrived, further escalation led to a fatal assault.",

That's a complex topic with many facets.\n\nAsserting power does not necessarily mean being aggressive. It could be as simple as setting clear boundaries and standing up for yourself. Physically being strong or having influence certainly can make a difference in many situations.\n\nResisting also has many forms, from persistent insistence, negotiating, or simply ignoring and doing as you please.\n\nOpen communication",
