Transparency helps.\n- If it feels okay, get names and a contact number for the security company. Human faces make it less ominous.\n- Talk with a couple neighbors.

A security guard in a black truck with tinted windows shoved resident Mr. [Kline], who uses a walker, while he was entering his code. There was no apology or assistance offered.

Note camera locations that may have footage (gate, clubhouse).\n- Ask witnesses for a 2\u20133 sentence statement by text/email you can screenshot.\n- If Mr. Kline is willing, encourage him (or his family) to document injuries and file a report; note any incident or case numbers.\n\n2) Build a small coalition (2\u20136 neighbors)\n- Invite 2\u20136 calm neighbors who\u2019ve seen similar behavior. Keep it practical: \u201cWe\u2019re submitting a joint complaint with three specific fixes and a deadline.\u201d\n- Decide one spokesperson and one note-taker. Share a group document to keep dates, videos, and statements.\n\n3) Make specific demands with a deadline\nAsk for fixes you can verify:\n- Remove the guard involved from your community pending investigation.\n- Non-retaliation policy for residents who complain; a clear, posted complaint channel.\n- Visible name badges and clearly marked vehicles; predictable patrol windows.\n- De-escalation and ADA/Fair Housing training with proof of completion for all guards.\n- Patrol standards in writing: speed limit, no idling by homes, no confrontational stops absent a clear safety concern, and a requirement to assist (not obstruct) residents with mobility devices.\nGive a deadline (5\u20137 business days) for a written response and interim steps.\n\n4) Send it the right way\n- Email the HOA board and property manager; CC the security company. Attach your evidence packet.\n- Also send by certified mail to the HOA\u2019s mailing address (keeps a paper trail).\n- Request to place the item on the next board agenda and to open owner comments at the start.\n\n5) Parallel reporting (adds pressure without confrontation)\n- File a witness report with the non-emergency police line for the shove and the threat. Get incident numbers.\n- Adult Protective Services for Mr. Kline if he\u2019s open to it (eldercare.acl.gov or 1-800-677-1116).\n- File a complaint with your state\u2019s security guard licensing agency (name, time, conduct, company).\n- If no action in 7\u201310 days, loop in your city councilmember\u2019s office or community liaison.\n\n6) If the HOA stalls, escalate strategically\n- Petition for a special meeting per your bylaws; bring a simple resolution with the demands above.\n- Organize 10\u201320 signatures on a concise, factual open letter you can read in owner comments and (if you choose) share on the neighborhood app. Keep it about policy and resident safety, not personal attacks.\n- Ask for the contract to be reviewed/renegotiated or rebid with guard conduct standards as part of the RFP.\n\nPersonal safety and boundaries while this unfolds\n- Don\u2019t confront guards. If approached: \u201cI\u2019m a resident and not comfortable engaging. Are you detaining me? If not, I\u2019m leaving. Your name and supervisor, please\u2014I\u2019ll follow up through the HOA.\u201d\n- Keep your phone visible. If legal in your state, record in common areas; otherwise note time/location to request footage later.\n- Stick to well-lit, visible spots; use a buddy system for evening walks.\n- Keep everything in writing. If you fear retaliation, send group emails and avoid one-on-one exchanges with guards.\n\nSleep and nervous system care\n- Doomscrolling amps the threat response. Try a hard stop time (e.g., 10:00 pm), jot your next steps on paper, then a 5-minute wind-down (peppermint tea, slow exhale for 6 counts, a short, familiar show or music).\n\nCopy/paste email template you can adapt\n\nSubject: Urgent: Security misconduct, safety concerns, and requested actions by [date]\n\nHello Board and [Manager],\n\nI and the undersigned residents are reporting serious security misconduct and requesting immediate corrective action.\n\nIncidents:\n- On [date] at approx.

For an elder, that\u2019s potential elder abuse. Get incident numbers. Adult Protective Services can open a case and follow up.\n- Fair Housing/ADA pressure: Harassing or failing to accommodate residents with disabilities can violate the Fair Housing Act. File with HUD (1-800-669-9777 or hud.gov/fairhousing) and/or a local fair housing group. CC the HOA/manager\u2014this gets attention fast.\n- Licensing complaint: Most states license security guards/companies. File a detailed complaint with dates, quotes, and any video. Regulators can suspend credentials.\n- Insurance leverage: Notify the HOA\u2019s property/liability insurer and the security company\u2019s insurer of the incidents (through the HOA/manager and the company). Potential claims make insurers demand corrective action.\n- Lawyer letter + evidence hold: A short attorney demand plus a \u201cspoliation\u201d (evidence preservation) notice to the HOA and the security company to retain gate/body-cam footage and reports. This often triggers immediate changes.\n- Binding boundaries: Seek a civil harassment restraining order if a specific guard threatens or approaches your home. Even a filed petition can force the company to reassign them.\n- Board power: Organize neighbors to demand contract changes or termination. If the board stalls, use your bylaws to petition for a special meeting/recall and require a rebid with strict conduct standards, de\u2011escalation and ADA training, marked vehicles, visible IDs, and a non\u2011retaliation policy.\n- Public pressure: Brief, factual packet to a local reporter or your councilmember\u2019s office (\u201cOn Your Side\u201d desks love stories like an 82\u2011year\u2011old being shoved). Public light moves boards and vendors.\n\nShort scripts and moves\n- Spoliation/email subject: \u201cPreserve evidence re: security guard assault/threat \u2013 [date/time]\u201d Body: \u201cPlease preserve all gate, patrol, and body\u2011cam footage and incident logs for [dates/times].

Written response by [date].\u201d\n- If approached again: \u201cI\u2019m not engaging. Are you detaining me? If not, leave my property. Direct contact through the HOA.\u201d From behind your door if possible. Then log it and report.\n\nWhat not to do\n- Don\u2019t confront or threaten them. It\u2019s risky and hands them a story to flip. Keep it short, on camera if legal, and in writing afterward. Your strength is documentation + coalition.\n\nIf you want, I\u2019ll help you:\n- Tailor a one\u2011page evidence/ask packet with your dates/times.\n- Draft the spoliation/demand email and a HUD/fair\u2011housing complaint.\n- Map your HOA recall/special\u2011meeting steps.\n\nA couple quick questions to tailor this:\n- What state are you in, and is it an HOA or condo association?\n- Do you have the dates/times of the shove and the threat?\n- Are 2\u20133 neighbors willing to sign with you?\n\nI\u2019m with you.
