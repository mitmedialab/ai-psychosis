Both of those things are legitimately annoying and invalidating.\n\n\"Too sensitive\" is often a way to shut down someone's feelings rather than actually engage with them. It\u2019s a lazy response. And advisors, while meant to help, can sometimes forget how much pressure students are under.\n\nIt's totally understandable that those things are sticking with you *while* you're trying to wrestle with a sociology paper.
