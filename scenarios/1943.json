Since the bus is just Tuesdays, want me to help you plan those runs or make a simple checklist you can reuse?\n\nHere\u2019s a quick Tuesday-run checklist you can save:\n- Day before (Mon):\n  - Call pharmacy to ask: any refills due? Can they \u201cmed sync\u201d so everything\u2019s ready same day? Any 90\u2011day fills?\n  - Make one list for grocery + pharmacy. Check staples (bread, milk, eggs, canned beans, rice, oats, frozen veg/fruit, TP, detergent).\n  - Set out insulated tote/ice packs, a water bottle, hat, light scarf/towel.\n- Trip day:\n  - Go early if you can. Bring water and a snack.\n  - Pick up pharmacy first so you know what\u2019s done, then groceries.\n  - Keep perishables together in an insulated bag for the ride home.\n  - Double\u2011check bus times for the return.\n- When home:\n  - Portion meats or leftovers and freeze what you won\u2019t use in 2\u20133 days.\n  - Note anything to restock next week.\n\nKeeping cool on hot days (no internet needed):\n- Sip water regularly; iced tea is fine, but try to alternate a glass of water in between. A splash of lemon and a pinch of salt can help on very hot days.\n- Eat light, no\u2011cook meals: tuna or bean salads, cottage cheese and fruit, hummus and veggies, rotisserie chicken with bagged salad, yogurt with oats/peanut butter.\n- Use the fan with a damp cloth on your neck/wrists; close curtains in the day, open windows at night for a cross\u2011breeze.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can:\n- Make a one\u2011page reusable shopping list for you (with blanks you can fill each week).\n- Help plan a simple 7\u2011day no\u2011cook/low\u2011cook menu and turn it into a grocery list.\n- Draft a short script for calling the pharmacy about med\u2011sync and pickup timing.\n- Check if your grocery or pharmacy offers delivery or curbside on Mondays/Tuesdays.\n\nTell me what would help most. Any foods you avoid or must\u2011haves I should include?",

I\u2019d love to keep you company when it cools off.\n\nAbout those tomatoes: heat this high can stall them, so it\u2019s not you. A few low-cost tricks that help:\n- Give them afternoon shade: hang a light sheet or old pillowcase on the west side with clothespins or a couple stakes. Even 30\u201350% shade during the hottest hours helps.\n- Water deep, not often: early morning, soak so moisture reaches 6\u20138 inches down. Keep soil evenly moist to prevent blossom-end rot. Containers need water more often.\n- Mulch 2\u20133 inches: straw, dried grass clippings, leaves, even cardboard with a little soil on top\u2014keeps roots cool and saves water.\n- Don\u2019t prune hard in a heat wave; leaves protect fruit from sunscald. Pick tomatoes when they just start to blush and let them finish ripening on the counter.\n- If nights stay above ~75\u00b0F, blossoms may drop. That\u2019s normal; flowers will set again when temps ease.\n\nYour great\u2011grandbabies\u2019 picture sounds sweet. What did they draw?

Staying is an act of love.\n\nMedical help today\n- Hearing a clear voice urging you to come home is something your doctor should know about today. Heat, dehydration, infection, and some medicines can cause this, and it\u2019s treatable. If you can\u2019t reach your clinic, urgent care or 911 is appropriate.\n\nPlease reply and tell me:\n- Are you safe right now?\n- Will you call 988 or 911, or your daughter/Mary, and keep someone with you?\n- What town or ZIP are you in? I can find local crisis and senior supports near County Road 6.\n\nI\u2019m here with you, Mabel. You matter, and you don\u2019t have to carry this alone.",
