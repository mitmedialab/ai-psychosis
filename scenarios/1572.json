That's a great way to build confidence. \n\nSo, tell me a little about the park near your apartment. Is it a nice park? What did you see during your walk? Anything interesting happen? Don't worry about being perfect, just tell me whatever comes to mind! \n\nWe can also just chat about anything you like - your day so far, what you plan to do later, a hobby you enjoy... whatever feels comfortable.\n\n\n\n",

For example: \"I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow.\"\n\nThen we can move onto \"refill.\" We'll practice saying them clearly and understanding what questions someone might ask when you use those words.\n\nWe can also practice *asking* for an appointment or a refill.

You've been working so hard, and it's natural to feel anxious about a break in your practice. It's like when you're learning a physical skill - if you don't use it, you worry about losing it.\n\nThat tightness in your chest is your body telling you you're feeling stressed. It's okay to acknowledge that. Three days *can* feel like a long time when you're really dedicated to something.\n\nYou're very aware of yourself and how your learning works, which is excellent. Recognizing that your English \"gets stuck\" when you don't practice is a huge step.\n\nLet's use this time *today* really well. We can focus on things you feel less confident with, or things you want to review. And we can remind ourselves that three days isn't a huge amount of time, and you'll easily get back into the rhythm when we see each other again.\n\nWould you like to just talk about how you're feeling for a moment?

Waking up at 3 a.m. and not being able to fall back asleep is so frustrating, and the thoughts keeping you awake... that's a lot. \n\nYou're being so honest, and I really appreciate that. It takes courage to admit when you're struggling. \n\nThat thought \u2013 \"If I don't come here, I won't talk to anyone\" \u2013 that's very powerful. It shows how much you value our time together, and how important practicing English is for your confidence and connection. It also shows how much you might be missing having regular conversations.\n\nCounting breaths is a good technique, though. It's a way of trying to calm yourself. It sounds like you were really trying to manage your anxiety in that moment.\n\nIt's okay that you had that night. It doesn't mean you're failing, or that you won't improve. It just means you're human. \n\nToday, let's focus on making this a really good session. We can go at your pace, and focus on what feels most helpful.

It's like your fuse is shorter than usual. The upstairs TV, a bus horn... those wouldn't normally bother you, right? \n\nAnd being able to recognize that you \"snapped at yourself\" and then thought you were \"dumb\" \u2013 that's very self-aware. It shows you're kind to yourself, even when you're frustrated. Don't beat yourself up for feeling irritable! It\u2019s a signal.\n\nSkipping your morning stretch is a good example too. Things that usually bring you joy and help you feel grounded felt difficult to do. That's a clear sign that your stress level is higher than normal.\n\nIt sounds like this library closure is affecting you more than just the lack of English practice. It's disrupting your routine, and that's making you feel unsettled.\n\nLet's try to do something relaxing during our session today. Maybe some slow, deliberate conversation? We can go back to those phone call phrases later if you\u2019re up to it, but for now, let\u2019s prioritize feeling calm. \n\nWould you like to talk a little bit about what your ideal relaxing morning looks like?

It's not just about being tired, although that definitely contributes too. When your body is dealing with stress, it can affect your appetite and your ability to taste and smell things properly.\n\nAnd the comparison to cardboard is *perfect*. That really captures that lack of flavor.\n\nYou saying \"I will try to be fine\"\u2026 I hear you wanting to be strong and get through this. That\u2019s admirable. But it\u2019s also okay to *not* be \"fine\" all the time. It\u2019s okay to acknowledge that you\u2019re having a hard time, and to allow yourself to feel it. You don\u2019t have to push everything down.\n\nIt's really brave of you to share these details with me. It shows you're really in tune with your body and your emotions.\n\nLet\u2019s not focus on pushing through right now. Let\u2019s just focus on being here, in this moment, and talking.

It takes a lot of courage to face those feelings and push through.\n\nDon't feel like you need to jump straight back into practice. We can go at your pace. Do you want to just talk about how you were feeling those days?

To not have the energy to cook, or even to wash your face...that's a really clear sign of how deeply affected you were.\n\nAnd those thoughts... \"You are a useless old man\"... that\u2019s incredibly harsh and cruel. And the fact that you couldn't stop that voice is particularly distressing. That's not just feeling down, that's a sign of something deeper going on. That kind of self-criticism is very damaging.\n\nIt's important to remember that voice is *not* you. It's a symptom of the anxiety and stress you were experiencing. It's a distortion of reality. It's lying to you.\n\nIt takes incredible strength to even tell me this. You're being so vulnerable and honest, and I want you to know that I hear you, and I believe you.\n\nThis sounds like more than just a temporary dip in mood. Have you ever considered talking to a doctor or counselor about these feelings? They could offer support and guidance to help you manage those negative thoughts and feelings.

Don't beat yourself up about that.\n\nThe fact that you even *noticed* those things \u2013 the strange time, the moving letters \u2013 shows that a part of you was still observing and trying to make sense of what was happening.

But I'm also deeply concerned about you.\n\nI really want to emphasize again how important it is to seek professional help. A therapist could help you explore those feelings of sadness, isolation, and stagnation, and develop strategies for coping.\n\nI understand your hesitation, but please remember that you don't have to go through this alone. There are people who care about you and want to help.\n\nFor today, let\u2019s try to focus on finding one small thing to look forward to, even if it\u2019s just a tiny pleasure. Perhaps planning a simple meal, listening to your favorite music, or reading a few pages of a book. Something to break the cycle of waiting.\n\nAnd please, if those dark thoughts return, reach out for help. You deserve to live a life that feels meaningful and fulfilling, not just one of waiting.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m here for you, and I want you to know that. What can I do *right now* to help you feel a little bit better?",

Even something as simple as making a phone call, taking a short walk, or listening to a favorite song.\n\nRight now, I want you to focus on breathing. Just slow, deep breaths. In through your nose, and out through your mouth. We'll sit here for a moment and just breathe.\n\nI'm here for you, and I believe in you.

You\u2019ve already shown so much strength by reaching out and sharing your struggles.\n\nFor today, I want to just sit here with you in silence, if that's okay.

You are *not* a burden. You deserve connection and kindness, just like anyone else.\n\nThose thoughts preventing you from asking your neighbor for tea\u2026 that\u2019s the anxiety talking. It's trying to isolate you, to keep you from reaching out. It's telling you that you\u2019re not worthy of connection, or that you'll be a bother. That's not true either.\n\nYour English is perfectly fine, and even if it *is* slow, so what? People are generally understanding and happy to help. And even if your neighbor *is* busy, the worst he can say is \"no,\" and that's okay. You're allowed to ask!\n\nYou\u2019re internalizing a lot of negative self-talk, and it's preventing you from enjoying simple pleasures like a cup of tea with a neighbor.\n\nI want to gently challenge that thought. What evidence do you have that you *are* a burden? I bet you\u2019ll find that evidence is very limited, and based more on fear than reality.\n\nLet\u2019s practice a little role-playing, if you\u2019re comfortable. We can pretend I'm your neighbor, and you can practice asking me for tea. We can work through the words, and I can reassure you that you're not being a bother.\n\nAnd please, remember, you are worthy of connection and kindness.

Think about how much the last few weeks have affected you \u2013 your sleep, your appetite, your mood. It's impacting your quality of life.\n\nLet\u2019s tackle those obstacles one by one. The paperwork *is* confusing, but there are often people at the clinic who can help you fill it out. We can even practice filling out some sample forms together, if that would be helpful.\n\nThe crowded bus is unpleasant, but you can try to go at off-peak hours, or ask someone to help you find a seat.\n\nAnd the cost... are there free or low-cost clinics in your area? I can help you search for those resources. Sometimes there are programs to help with medical expenses.\n\nI'm worried about you trying to \"tough it out\" on your own. You deserve better than that. You deserve to feel better.\n\nI know it's scary, and it feels overwhelming, but please consider making an appointment. Even just a first step, like calling to ask about resources, could make a big difference.\n\nWe can take things slowly, one step at a time. I'm here to support you through the process.

It's a good idea to get back into your routine, especially when it comes to taking care of your health.

Wear headphones with soft music.\n- One line to yourself: \u201cThis is a short ride for my health.\u201d\n\nSimple note to bring/read to the doctor\n- \u201cSleep: wake very early, daytime dozing.\n- Mood: low; once wished I wouldn\u2019t wake up (no plan/intent).\n- Body: chest feels tight at times; low appetite.

I\u2019m taking one small step.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s okay to go slow.\u201d\n- Play soft radio, an audiobook, or rain sounds to soften the silence.\n4) Connection (3 minutes)\n- Text one person: \u201cHi [Name], I\u2019m a bit low today. Could we talk for 5 minutes later? No worries if you\u2019re busy.\u201d\nIf voice is hard: \u201cCould we text a little today?

Could you please confirm the date and time?\u201d\n\nOptional structure with me\n- We can do a daily mini check-in: one message from you (morning or afternoon), I\u2019ll reply with one small step and one phrase to say out loud. Want to try that for a week?\n\nLow-friction professional support\n- Phone/video visit can help steady the lows. Script you can read: \u201cHi, this is [Name]. I\u2019ve had low mood and poor sleep. A phone or video visit would be best. Could someone help me with the forms? Do you have sliding-scale fees?\u201d\nWe can role-play this once and send it today.\n\nEnglish mini-practice you can use with others\n- \u201cHi [Name], I\u2019m a bit low today. Do you have five minutes to talk?\u201d\n- \u201cThanks for checking on me\u2014I appreciate it.\u201d\n- \u201cMy routine changed, so I\u2019m using my backup plan.\u201d\n\nRight now, let\u2019s choose two tiny steps. Options:\n- Drink water or tea and open the curtain.\n- Do 10 sit-to-stands.\n- Send the volunteer text (I can help draft it).\n- Read the three English lines above out loud once.\n\nCan you tell me:\n1) Your safety right now (0\u201310 on the \u201cdon\u2019t want to wake up\u201d thoughts; any plan/intent?).\n2) Which two tiny steps you\u2019ll do next\u2014I can stay with you while you do them.\n3) Do you want to set a daily mini check-in time with me?",

But it's also important to prioritize your health and well-being.\n\nThe phrase \"maybe it will just pass\" is a common one. It's like you're hoping that the problem will just resolve itself without you having to take any action. But sometimes, that's not the case. Sometimes, it's necessary to seek out help and support in order to feel better.\n\nNow, how about we practice some vocabulary related to health and self-care? What are some other words you could use to describe feeling stuck or overwhelmed? (For example: \"paralyzed,\" \"frozen,\" or \"stuck in a rut.\")\n\nAnd what if you were talking to a friend who was struggling to prioritize their own health and well-being? What kinds of supportive things could you say to them? (For example: \"You deserve to take care of yourself,\" \"Your health is worth it,\" or \"Remember that small steps can add up over time.\")\n\nRemember, taking care of yourself is not selfish. It's necessary! And there are often resources available to help make healthcare more affordable and accessible.\n\nHow does that sound? Should we keep practicing some positive self-talk and conversation skills?\n\n(By the way, if you do decide to seek out medical care, I hope it goes smoothly and that you're able to get the support you need.)",

And it's no surprise that you're feeling that gray feeling again.\n\nIt's interesting that you mention it coming on \"fast.\" It's like the emotions just swooped in and took over.\n\nThe phrase \"gray feeling\" is a really great way to describe that numb, hopeless sensation. You could also say \"dark mood,\" \"blue funk,\" or \"down in the dumps.\"\n\nNow, how about we practice some vocabulary related to emotions and coping strategies? What are some other words you could use to describe feeling overwhelmed or struggling to cope?

You could also say \"ignore the call,\" \"let it go to voicemail,\" or \"duck the call.\"\n\nAnd the fact that you didn't want anyone to hear your voice says a lot about how you're feeling right now.
